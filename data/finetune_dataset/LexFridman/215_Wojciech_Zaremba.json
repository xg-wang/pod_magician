{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "The Fermi paradox", "output": "you mentioned that sam altman asked about the fermi paradox\nand the people at open ai had really sophisticated interesting answers so that's when you knew this is the right\nteam to be working with so let me ask you about the fermi paradox about aliens\nwhy have we not found overwhelming evidence for aliens visiting earth i don't have a conviction in the answer\nbut rather kind of probabilistic perspective on what might be a let's say possible answers it's also interesting\nthat the question itself even can't touch on the you know your typical\nquestion of what's the meaning of life because like if you assume that like we don't see aliens because they destroy themselves that kind of upwards their\nfocus on making sure that we won't destroy ourselves yeah and at the moment the\nplace where i am actually with my belief and these things also change over the time is i think that we might be alone in the\nuniverse which actually makes life more or less a consciousness life more kind of valuable and that means\nthat we should more appreciate it have you always been alone so what's your intuition about our galaxy our\nuniverse is it just sprinkled with graveyards of intelligent civilizations or are we truly is is life\nintelligent life truly unique at the moment my belief that it is unique but i would say i could also\nyou know there was like some footage released with ufo objects which makes me\nactually doubt my own belief yes yeah i can tell you one crazy answer\nthat i have heard yes so apparently when you look actually at the\nlimits of computation you can compute more if the temperature of the universe would\ndrop down so one of the things that aliens might want to do if they are\ntruly optimizing to maximize amount of compute which you know maybe can lead to or let's say simulations or so it's\ninstead of wasting current entropy of the universe because you know we by living we are actually somewhat wasting\nentropy then you can wait for the universe to cool down such that you have more computation that's kind of a funny\nanswer i'm not sure if i believe in it but that would be one of the reasons why you don't see aliens it's also possible\nsee some people say that maybe there is not that much point in actually going to other galaxies\nif you can go inwards so there is no limits of what could be an experience\nif we could you know connect machines to our brains while there are still some limits if we\nwant to explore universe yeah there could be a lot of ways to go inwards too\nonce you figure out some aspect of physics we haven't figured out yet maybe you can travel to different dimensions i\nmean travel in three-dimensional space may\nnot be the most fun kind of travel there may be like just a huge amount of different ways to travel and it doesn't\nrequire a spaceship going slowly in 3d space space time it also\nfeels you know one of the problems is that speed of light is low and universe is vast yeah and um\nit seems that actually most likely if we want to travel very far then then we would instead of actually\nsending spaceships with humans that wait a lot we would send something similar to what yuri\nmiller is working on these are like a huge uh sail which is at first powered power there is a shot of laser from an\nearth and it can propel it to a quarter of speed of light and uh sail itself\ncontains a few grams of equipment and that might be the way to actually\ntransport matter through universe but then when you think what would it mean for humans it means that\nwe would need to actually put their 3d printer and you know 3d print a human on other planet i don't know play them\nyoutube or let's say or like a pre 3d print like a huge human right away or maybe a womb or so um yeah\nwith our current techniques of archaeology if a civilization was born and died\nlong long enough ago on earth we wouldn't be able to tell and so that makes me really sad\nand so i think about earth in that same way how can we leave some remnants if we\ndo destroy ourselves how can we leave remnants for aliens in the future to discover\nlike here's some nice stuff we've done like wikipedia and youtube do we have it like\nin a satellite orbiting earth with a hard drive like how how do we say\nhow do we back up human civilization uh for the good parts or all of it is good parts\nso that uh it can be preserved longer than our bodies can that's a\nthat's kind of a it's a difficult question it also requires the difficult acceptance of the\nfact that we may die and if we die we may die suddenly as a civilization\nso let's see i think it kind of depends on the cataclysm we have observed in other parts of the universe that births\nof gamma rays these are high energy rays of light that actually can\napparently kill entire galaxy so there might be actually nothing even\nto nothing to protect us from it i'm also when i'm looking actually at the past civilization so it's like aztecs or so\nthey disappear from the surface of the earth and one can ask\nwhy is it the case and the way i'm thinking about it is\nyou know that definitely they had some problem that they couldn't solve and maybe there was a flat and all of a\nsudden they couldn't drink there was no potable water and they all died and\ni think that so far the best solution to such a problems is\ni guess technology so i mean if they would know that you can just boil water and then drink it after then that would\nsave their civilization and even now when we look actually at the current pandemic it seems that once again\nactually science comes to rescue and somehow science increases size of the action space and i think that's a good\nthing yeah but nature has a vastly larger action space but\nstill it might be a good thing for us to keep on increasing action space\nokay looking at past civilizations yes but looking at the destruction of human\ncivilization perhaps expanding the action space will add\nactions that are easily acted upon easily executed and as a\nresult destroy us so let's see i was pondering\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Systems of government", "output": "why actually even we have negative impact on the globe because you know if you ask every\nsingle individual they would like to have clean air they would like healthy planet but\nsomehow it actually is not the case that as a collective we are not going this direction\ni think that there exists very powerful system to describe what we value that's capitalism it assigns actually monetary\nvalues to various activities at the moment the problem in the current system\nis that there are some things which we value there is no cost assigned to it so even though we value clean air or maybe\nwe also value lack of destruction on the internet or\nso at the moment these quantities you know companies corporations can pollute them uh for\nfree so in some sense\ni wish or like and that's i guess purpose of politics to\nalign the incentive systems and we are kind of maybe even moving in this direction the first issue is even to be\nable to measure the things that we value then we can actually assign the monetary value to them\nyeah and that's so it's getting the data and also probably through technology enabling\npeople to vote and to move money around in a way that is\naligned with their values and that's very much a technology question so like\nhaving one president and congress and voting that happens every four years\nor something like that that's a very outdated idea there could be some technological improvements to\nthat kind of idea so i'm thinking from time to time about these topics but it also feels to me\nthat it's it's a little bit like a it's hard for me to actually make correct predictions what is the\nappropriate thing to do i extremely trust uh sam altman our ceo\non these topics he um okay i'm more on the side of being i guess\nnaive hippie that yeah that's your life philosophy um\nwell like i think self-doubt and uh i think hippie implies optimism those\nthose two things are pretty pretty good way to operate i mean still it is hard for me to actually\nunderstand how the politics works or like uh how this like exactly how the things would play out\nand sam is a really excellent with it what do you think is rarest in the universe you said we might be alone\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Life, intelligence, and consciousness", "output": "what's hardest to build is another engineering way to ask that life intelligence or consciousness so like\nyou said that we might be alone which is the thing that's hardest to get to\nis it just the origin of life is it the origin of intelligence is it the origin\nof consciousness so um let me at first explain you my kind\nof mental model what i think is needed for life to appear um so\ni imagine that at some point there was this primordial zoop of\namino acids and maybe some proteins in the ocean and you know some proteins were turning\ninto some other proteins through reaction and you can almost think about this\nuh cycle of what turns into what as there is a graph essentially describing which substance turns into some other\nsubstance and essentially life means that all the sudden in the graph has been created a cycle such that the same\nthing keeps on happening over and over again that's what is needed for life to happen and in some sense you can think\nalmost that you have this gigantic graph and it needs like a sufficient number of\nedges for the cycle to appear then um from perspective of intelligence\nand consciousness my current intuition is that they might be quite intertwined first of all it might\nnot be that it's like a binary thing that you have intelligence or consciousness it seems to be a\nmore a continuous component let's see if we look for instance on the even networks\nrecognizing images and people are able to show that the activations of these networks correlate very strongly\nwith activations in visual cortex of some monkeys the same seems to be\ntrue about language models also if you for instance\nlook if you train agent in a 3d world\nat first you know it it it it barely recognizes what is going on over the time it kind of recognizes foreground\nfrom a background over the time it kind of knows where there is a foot and it just follows it\nover the time it actually starts having a 3d perception so it is possible for instance to look inside of the head of\nan agent and ask what would it see if it looks to the right and the crazy thing is you know initially when the agents\nare very trained these predictions are pretty bad over the time they they become better and better you can still\nsee that if you ask what happens when the head is turned by 360 degrees for some\ntime they think that the different thing appears and then at some stage they understand actually that the same\nthing's supposed to appear so they get like a understanding of 3d structure it's also you know very likely that they\nhave inside some level of and of like a symbolic reasoning like they're particularly\nsymbols for other agents so when you look at dota agents they collaborate\ntogether and uh and now they they they have some anticipation of uh if if they would win\nbattle they have some some expectations with respect to other agents i might be you know too much anthropomorphizing\num the the how the things look look for me but then the fact that they\nhave a symbol for other agents and makes me believe that at some stage as the uh you know as they\nare optimizing for skills they would have also symbol to describe themselves this is like a very useful\nsymbol to have and this particularity i would call it like a self-consciousness or self-awareness\nand still it might be different from the consciousness so i guess the the way how\ni'm understanding the word consciousness let's say the experience of drinking a coffee or let's say experience of being\na butt that's the meaning of the word consciousness it doesn't mean to be awake\nyeah it feels it might be also somewhat related to memory and recurrent connections so um\nit's kind of okay if you look at anesthetic drugs they might be\nuh like they essentially they disturb\nbrain waste such that [Music] maybe memory is not not formed\nso there's a lessening of consciousness when you do that correct and so that's one way to intuit what is consciousness\nthere's also kind of another element here it could be that it's\nyou know this kind of self-awareness module that you described\nplus the actual subjective experience is a storytelling module\nthat tells us a story about uh what we're experiencing\nthe crazy thing so let's say i mean in meditation they teach people\nnot to speak story inside of the head and there is also some fraction of population\nwho doesn't have actually narrator i know people who don't have a right narrator and you know they have to use\nexternal people in order to kind of solve tasks that require internal\nnarrator so it seems that it's possible to have the experience without the talk\nwhat are we talking about when we talk about the internal narrator is that the voice when you're like yeah i thought\nthat that that's what you are referring to well i was referring more on the like\nnot an actual voice i meant like there's some kind of\nlike subjective experience feels like it's\nit's fundamentally about storytelling to ourselves it feels like\nlike the feeling is a story that is much\nmuch simpler abstraction than the raw sensory information so it feels like it's a very high level\nabstraction that is useful for me to feel like\nentity in this world most useful aspect of it is that\nbecause i'm conscious i think there's an intricate connection to me not one\nwanting to die so like it's a useful hack to really\nprioritize not dying like those seem to be somehow connected so i'm telling the story of like it's\nrichly feels like something to be me and the fact that me exists in this world i\nwant to preserve me and so that makes it a useful agent hack so i will just refer maybe to the first\npart as you said about the kind of story of describing who you are\ni was thinking about that even so you know obviously i'm i'm i\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "GPT language model", "output": "like thinking about consciousness uh i like thinking about the ai as well and i'm trying to see analogies of these\nthings in ai what would it correspond to so um\nyou know openly i trained a a model called gpt\nwhich can generate a pretty amusing text on arbitrary topic\nand um and one way to control gpd is uh by putting into prefix at the\nbeginning of the text some information what would be the story about you can have even chat with uh\nyou know with gpt by saying that the chat is with lex or elon musk or so and gpt would just\npretend to be you or elon musk or so and it almost feels that this uh\nstory that we give ourselves to describe our life it's almost like a\nthings that you put into context of gpt yeah the primary it's the and but the the context we provide to gpt\nis uh is multimodal it's so gpt itself is multimodal gpt itself uh hasn't learned\nactually from experience of single human but from the experience of humanity it's a chameleon you can turn it into\nanything and in some sense by providing context uh it you know\nbehaves as the thing that you wanted it to be and it's interesting that the you know people have a stories of who\nthey are and as i said these stories they help them to operate in the world\nbut it's also you know interesting i guess various people find it out through meditation or so that\nthere might be some patterns that you have learned when you were a kid that actually are not serving you anymore\nand you also might be thinking that that's who you are and that's actually just the story\nyeah so it's a useful hack but sometimes it gets us into trouble it's a local optima\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Engineering consciousness", "output": "you wrote that stephen hawking he tweeted stephen hawking asked what breathes fire into equations which meant\nwhat makes given mathematical equations realize the physics of a universe\nsimilarly i wonder what breathes fire into computation what makes given computation\nconscious okay so how do we engineer consciousness\nhow do you breathe fire and magic into the machine so\nit seems clear to me that not every computation is conscious i mean you can\nlet's say just keep on multiplying one matrix over and over again and my gigantic matrix you can put a lot of\ncomputation i don't think it would be conscious so in some sense the question is what are the computations which could be\nconscious uh i mean so one assumption is that it has to do purely with\ncomputation that you can abstract away matter and other possibilities that it's very important was the realization of\ncomputation that it has to do with some uh uh force fields or so and they bring\nconsciousness at the moment my intuition is that it can be fully abstracted that way so in case of computation you can\nask yourself what are the mathematical objects or so that could bring such a properties so for instance\nif we think about the models uh ai models then what they truly\ntry to do or like models like gpt is uh\nyou know they try to predict a next word or so and this turns out to be\nequivalent to compressing text\nand because in some sense compression means that you learn the model of reality and you\nhave just to uh remember where are your mistakes the better you are in predicting the\nand and in some sense when we look at our experience also when you look for instance the car driving you know in\nwhich direction it will go you are good like a in prediction and um you know it might be the case that the\nconsciousness is intertwined with compression it might be also the case that self-consciousness\nhas to do with compressor trying to compress itself so um okay i was just wondering what are the\nobjects in you know mathematics or computer science which are mysterious\nthat could uh that that could have to do with consciousness and then i thought um\nyou know you you see in uh mathematics there is something called cadal theorem\nwhich means okay you have if you have sufficiently complicated mathematical system it is possible to point the\nmathematical system back on itself in computer sense there is uh something called helping problem it's it's\nsomewhat similar construction so i thought that you know if we believe that that the that\nunder assumption that consciousness has to do with uh with compression uh\nthen you could imagine that the the as you keep on compressing things then at\nsome point it actually makes sense for the compressor to compress itself metacompression yeah consciousness is\nmetacompression that's uh that's and i and an idea\nand in some sense you know the creation of it thank you so uh but do you think if we think of a\ntouring machine a universal touring machine can that achieve consciousness\nso is there some thing beyond our traditional definition of computation that's required so it's a\nspecific computation and i said this computation has to do with compression and\nthe compression itself maybe other way of putting it is like you are internally creating the model of reality\nin order like a it's like a you try inside to simplify reality in order to predict what's going to happen\nand that also feels somewhat similar to how i think actually about my own conscious\nexperience so clearly i don't have access to reality the only access to reality is through you know cable going\nto my brain and my brain is creating a simulation of reality and i have access to the simulation of reality\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Is there an algorithm for intelligence?", "output": "are you by any chance uh aware of uh the harder prize marcus hutter\nhe he made this prize for compression of wikipedia pages\nand there's a few qualities to it one i think has to be perfect compression which makes\ni think that little quirk makes it much less um applicable to the general task of\nintelligence because it feels like intelligence is always going to be messy uh\nlike perfect compression is feels like it's not the right goal but it's\nnevertheless a very interesting goal so for him intelligence equals compression\nand so the smaller you make the file given a large wikipedia page\nthe more intelligent the system has to be yeah that makes sense so you can make perfect compression if you store errors\nand i think that actually what he meant is you have algorithm plus errors and by the way hooter hatter is a he was pa uh\nphd advisor of shenleck who is the mind uh uh deep mind co-founder yeah yeah so\nthere's an interesting and now he's a deep mind there's an interesting uh network of people he's\none of the people that i think seriously took on the task of what would\nan agi system look like i think for a longest time\nthe question of agi was not taken seriously or rather rigorously\nand he did just that like mathematically speaking what would the model look like\nif you remove the constraints of it having to be\nhaving to have a reasonable amount of memory reasonable amount of running time complexity uh\ncomputation time what would it look like and essentially it's it's a half math half philosophical discussion\nof uh how would like a reinforcement learning type of framework look like for an agi yeah so he developed a framework\neven to describe what's optimal with respect to reinforcement learning like there is a theoretical framework which\nis as you said under assumption there is infinite amount of memory and compute and there was actually one person before his name\nis solomonov hutter extended amount of work to reinforcement learning\nbut there exists a theoretical algorithm which is optimal\nalgorithm to build intelligence and i can actually explain you the algorithm yes\nlet's go let's go so the task itself can i just pause\nhow absurd it is for brain in a skull trying to explain the algorithm for intelligence just go\nahead it is pretty crazy it is pretty crazy that you know the brain itself is actually so small and it can ponder\nhow to design algorithms that optimally solve the problem of intelligence okay all right so what's the algorithm so\nlet's see so first of all the task itself is described as\nyou have infinite sequence of zeros and ones okay you read n bits and you are about\nto predict n plus one bit so that's the task and you could imagine that every task could be casted as such\na task so if for instance you have images and labels you can just turn every image into sequence of zeros and\nones then label you concatenate labels and you and that that's actually the the\nand you could you could start by having training data first and then afterwards you have test data\nso theoretically any problem could be casted as a problem of predicting zeros\nand ones on this infinite type so um so let's say you read already n bits and\nyou want to predict n plus one bit and i will ask you to write\nevery possible program that generates these end bits okay so\nand you can have you you choose programming language it can be in python or c\nand the difference between programming languages might be there is a difference by constant\nasymptotically your predictions will be equivalent so you you read and beats you enumerate\nall the programs that produce these and end bits in their output and then in order to predict n plus one\nbit you actually weight the programs according to their length\nand there is like some specific formula how you weight them and then the n plus\none bit prediction is the prediction uh from each of this program according to that weight\nlike statistically you statistically pick so the smaller the program the more likely you you are to pick the its\noutput so uh that's that algorithm is grounded\nin the hope or the intuition that the simple answer is the right one it's a formalization of\nit yeah um it also means like if you would ask the question after\nhow many years would you know sun explode\nyou can say it's more likely the answer is to some power because it's a shorter program\nyeah and then other well i don't have a good intuition about\nhow different the space of short programs are from the space of large programs\nlike what is the universe where short programs uh like run things\nuh so as i said the things have to agree with end beats so even if you have\nyou you need to start okay if if you have very short program and they're like uh still some as if it's not perfect\nwith prediction of n bits you have to start errors what are the errors and that gives you the full program that\nagrees on end beats oh so you don't agree perfectly with the end bits and you store\nthat's like a longer a longer program slightly longer program because it contains these extra bits of\nerrors that's fascinating what's what's your intuition about\nthe the programs that are able to do cool stuff like intelligence and consciousness are they\nuh perfectly like is is it uh is there if then statements in them so\nlike is there a lot of exceptions that they're storing so um you could imagine if there would be tremendous amount of\nif statements yeah then they wouldn't be that short in case of neural networks you could imagine that\nwhat happens is uh they when you start with an uninitialized\nneural network uh it stores internally many possibilities how the\nhow the problem can be solved and sgd is kind of magnifying some some\nsome paths which are slightly similar to the correct answer so it's\nkind of magnifying correct programs and in some sense hdd is a search algorithm\nin the program space and the program space is represented by uh you know kind\nof the wiring inside of the neural network and there's like an insane number of ways how that features can be\ncomputed let me ask you the high level basic question that's not so basic\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Neural networks and deep learning", "output": "what is deep learning is there a way you'd like to think of it that is different than like a generic\ntextbook definition the thing that i hinted just a second ago is maybe the uh closest to how i'm\nthinking these days about um deep learning so now the statement is\nuh neural networks can represent some programs uh it seems that various modules that we\nare actually adding up to are like a you know we we want networks to be deep because we we want multiple steps of the\ncomputation and and deep learning provides the way to\nrepresent space of programs which is searchable and it's searchable with stochastic gradient descent so we have\nan algorithm to search over a humongous number of programs and gradient descent kind of bubbles up\nthe things that are tend to give correct answers so a neural network\nwith a with fixed weights that's optimized do you think of that as a\nsingle program um so there is a work by christopher olach where he\nso he works on interpretability of neural networks and he was able to\nuh to identify inside of the neural network for instance a detector of a wheel for a\ncar or the detector of a mask for a car and then he was able to separate them out and assemble them uh together using\na simple program uh for the detector for a car detector that's like uh if you\nthink of traditionally defined programs that's like a function within a program that this particular neural network was\nable to find and you can tear that out just like you can copy and paste from stack overflow\nthat so uh any program is a composition of smaller programs\nyeah i mean the nice thing about the neural networks is that it allows the things to be more fuzzy than in case of\nprograms in case of programs you have this like a branching this way or that way and the\nneural networks they they have an easier way to to be somewhere in between or to share\nthings what to use the most beautiful or surprising idea in deep learning\nin the utilization of these neural networks which by the way for people who are not familiar\nneural networks is a bunch of uh what would you say it's inspired by the human brain there's neurons there's\nconnection between those neurons there's inputs and there's outputs and there's millions or billions of those neurons\nand the learning happens uh by adjusting the weights on the edges\nthat connect these neurons thank you for giving definition that i supposed to do it but i guess you have\nenough empathy to listeners to actually know that that might be useful no that's like\nso i'm asking plato of like what is the meaning of life he's not going to answer\nyou're being philosophical and deep and quite profound talking about the space of programs which is just very\ninteresting but also for people who are just not familiar with the hell we're talking about when we talk about deep\nlearning anyway sorry what is the most beautiful or surprising idea to you in in um in\nall the time you've worked at deep learning and you worked on a lot of fascinating projects\napplications of neural networks it doesn't have to be big and profound it can be a cool trick yeah i mean i'm\nthinking about the trick but like it's still amusing to me that it works at all yeah that let's say that the extremely\nsimple algorithm stochastic gradient descent which is something that i would be able you know to derive on the piece\nof paper to high school student uh when put at the ins at the scale of you know thousands\nof machines actually uh can create the behaviors we which we called kind of\nhuman like behaviors so in general any applications to cast a gradient descent to neural networks is\nis amazing to you so that or is there a particular application in natural language\nreinforcement learning uh and also would you attribute\nthat success too is it just scale what profound insight can we take from\nthe fact that the thing works for gigantic\nuh sets of variables i mean the interesting thing is these algorithms they were\ninvented uh decades ago and people actually\ngave up on the idea yeah and um you know back then they thought that we\nneed profoundly different algorithms and they spent a lot of cycles on very different algorithms and i believe that\nyou know we have seen that various various innovations that say like transformer or or dropout or so they can\nuh you know pass the help but it's also remarkable to me that this algorithm\nfrom 60s or so or i mean you can even say that the gradient descent was invented by leibniz\nin i guess 18th century or so that actually is the core of learning\nin the past people are it's almost like a out of the maybe an\nego people are saying that it cannot be the case that such a simple algorithm is there you know\nuh could solve complicated problems so they were in search for the\nother algorithms and as i'm saying like i believe that actually we are in the game where there is there are actually\nfrankly three levels there is compute there are algorithms and there is data and if we want to build intelligent\nsystems we have to pull all three levers and they are actually multiplicative\nand it's also interesting so you ask is it only compute people internally they did the studies\nto determine how much gains they were coming from different levels and so far we have seen that more gains came from\ncompute than algorithms but also we are in the world that in case of compute there is a kind of you know exponential\nincrease in funding and at some point it's impossible to invest more it's impossible to you know\ninvest 10 trillion dollars because we are speaking about that let's say all taxes in u.s\nuh but you're talking about money there could be innovation in the compute that's that's true as\nwell so i mean they're like a few pieces so one piece is human brain is an\nincredible super computer [Music] and they're like a\nit it has 100 trillion parameters or like a if you try to count\nvarious quantities in the brain there are like a neurons synapses that small number of neurons there is a lot of\nsynapses yeah it's unclear even how to map synapses\nto two parameters of neural networks but it's clear that there are many more yeah\nso it might be the case that our networks are still somewhat small\nit also might be the case that they are more efficient than brain or less efficient by some by some huge factor\ni also believe that there will be like a you know at the moment we are at the stage that the these neural networks\nthey require 1000x or like a huge factor of more data than humans do and it will\nbe a matter of there will be algorithms that\nvastly decrease sample complexity i believe so but the place where we are heading today is dark domains which\ncontains million x more data and even though computers might be\n1 000 times slower than humans in learning that's not the problem okay for instance\ni believe that it should be possible to create super human therapies\nuh by uh and and then they're like even simple steps of of doing what of of doing it\nand you know that the core reason is there is just machine will be able to read way more\ntranscripts of therapies and then it should be able to speak simultaneously with many more people and it should be\npossible to optimize it uh all in parallel and well there's now you're touching on\nsomething i deeply care about and think is way harder than we imagined um\nwhat's the goal of a therapist what's it called therapies so okay so one goal now this is\nterrifying to me but there's a lot of people that contemplate suicide suffer from\ndepression and they could significantly be helped with therapy\nand the idea that an ai algorithm might be in charge of that\nit's like a life and death task it's uh the stakes are high\nso one goal for a therapist whether human or ai\nis to prevent suicide ideation to prevent suicide how do you achieve that\nso let's see so to be clear i don't think that the current models are good enough for such\na task because it requires insane amount of understanding and patty and the models are far from this place but it's\nbut do you think that understanding empathy that signal is in the data um i\nthink there is some signal in the data yes i mean there are plenty of transcripts of conversations\nand it is possible to it is possible from it to understand personalities it is possible from it to\nunderstand uh if conversation is a friendly uh amicable uh\nantagonistic it is i believe that the you know given the fact that the models that we train now\nthey can they can have they are chameleons that they can have\nany personality they might turn out to be better in understanding uh personality of other people than\nanyone else and they feel pathetic to be empathetic yeah interesting uh but i wonder if there's\nsome level of multiple modalities required\nto be able to be empathetic of the human experience whether language is not enough to\nunderstand death to understand fear to understand uh childhood trauma\nto understand uh wit and humor required when you're dancing with the person who\nmight be depressed or suffering both humor and hope and love and all\nthose kinds of things so there's another underlying question which is self-supervised versus\nsupervised so can you get that from the data by just reading\na huge number of transcripts i actually so i think that reading huge number of transcripts is a step one it's like the\nsame way as you cannot learn to dance if just from youtube by watching it you\nhave to actually try it out yourself yeah and so i think that here that's a similar situation i also wouldn't deploy\nthe system in the high-stakes situations right away but kind of see gradually\nwhere it goes and obviously initially it would have to go hand with a hand in\nhand with humans but at the moment we are in the situation that actually\nthere is many more people who actually would like to have a therapy or or speak with with someone then there\nare therapies out there okay you know i was so so fundamentally i was thinking what are\nthe things that can vastly increase people well-being\ntherapy is one of them i think meditation is other one i guess maybe human connection is a third one and i\nguess pharmacologically it's also possible maybe direct brain stimulation or something like that but these are pretty\nmuch options out there then let's say the way i'm thinking about the agi endeavor is by default that's an\nendeavor to increase amount of wealth and i believe that we can vastly increase amount of\nwealth for everyone and simultaneously so i mean they're like two endeavors that\nmake sense to me one is like essentially increase amount of wealth and second one is uh increase overall human well-being\nand those are coupled together and they they can okay i would say these are different topics one can help another\n"}

{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Love is part of the human condition", "output": "of love like why is love part of the human condition why is it useful to combine the reward functions\nit seems like that doesn't i mean i don't think reinforcement learning frameworks can give us answers to why\neven even the hudder framework has an objective function that's static so we came to existence as\na consequence of evolutionary process and in some sense the purpose of evolution is survival and then the\nthis complicated optimization objective baked into us let's say compression\nwhich might help us operate in the real world and it bake into us various reward functions yeah\nand then to be clear at the moment we are operating in the regime which is somewhat out of distribution where the\nevent evolution optimized us it's almost like love is a consequence of cooperation that we've discovered is\nuseful correct in some way it's even the case if you i just love the idea that love is like the out of distribution\nor it's not out of distribution it's like as you that it evolved for cooperation yes and i believe that the cop like a in\nsome sense cooperation ends up helping each of us individually so it makes sense evolutionary and there is a in\nsome sense and you know love means there is this dissolution of boundaries that you have a shared reward function and we\nevolve to actually identify ourselves with larger groups so we we can identify\nourselves you know with a family we can identify ourselves with a country to such an extent that people are willing\nto give away their life for country [Music] so there is we are wired actually even\nuh for love and at the moment i guess the\nmaybe it would be somewhat more beneficial if you will if we would identify ourselves\nwith all the humanity as a whole so so you can clearly see when people travel around the world when they run into\nperson from the same country they say oh which ctr and all this like all of a sudden they find all these similarities\nthey they they find some they befriend those folks earlier than others so there\nis like a sense some sense of the belonging and i would say i think it would be overall good thing to the word\nfor people to move towards i think it's even called open\nindividualism and move toward the mindset of a larger and larger groups so\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Expanding our circle of empathy", "output": "the challenge there that's a beautiful vision and i share it to expand that circle of empathy that\ncircle of love towards the entirety of humanity but then you start to ask well where do you draw the line\nbecause why not expand it to other conscious beings and then at the finally\nfor our discussion something i think about is why not expand it to ai systems\nlike we we start respecting each other when the other the person the entity on the other side\nhas the capacity to suffer because then we develop a capacity to sort of empathize\nand so i could see ai systems that are interacting with humans more and more having conscious like\ndisplays so like they display consciousness through language and through other means\nand so then the question is like well is that consciousness because they're acting conscious\nand so you know the reason we don't like torturing animals\nis because they look like they're suffering when they're tortured and if ai looks like it's suffering\nwhen it's tortured how is that not\nrequiring of the same kind of empathy from us and respect and rights\nthat animals do and other humans do i think it requires empathy as well i mean i would like\ni guess us or humanity or so make a progress in understanding what consciousness is\nbecause i don't want just to be speaking about that the philosophy but rather actually make a scientific uh to have a\nlike a you know there was a time that people thought that there is a force of life\nand the things that have this force they are alive\nand i think that there is actually a path to understand exactly what consciousness is\nand um in some sense it might require essentially putting probes inside of a\nhuman brain what neuralink does so the goal there i mean there's several things with consciousness that\nmake it a real discipline which is one is rigorous measurement of consciousness\nand then the other is the engineering of consciousness which may or may not be related i mean you could also run into\ntrouble like for example in the united states for the department d.o.t department of\ntransportation and a lot of different places put a value on human life i think dot's\nuh values nine million dollars per person sort of in that same way you can get\ninto trouble if you put a number on how conscious a being is\nbecause then you can start making policy if a cow is uh 0.1\nor like um 10 as conscious as a human then you can start making calculations and might get\nyou into trouble but then again that might be a very good way to do it i would like uh\nto move to that place that actually we have scientific understanding what consciousness is yeah and then we'll be\nable to actually assign value and i believe that there is even the path for the experimentation in it so uh you know\nwe said that you know you could put the probes inside of the brain there is actually few other things that you could\ndo with devices like neuralink so you could imagine that the way even to measure if ai system is conscious\nis by literally just plugging into the brain and i mean that that seems that's kind of easy but the plugging into the brain\nand asking person if they feel that their consciousness expanded this direction of course has some issues\nyou can say you know if someone takes a psychedelic drug they might feel that their consciousness expanded even though\nthat drug itself is not conscious right so like you can't fully trust the self-report of a person saying their\ntheir consciousness is expanded or not let me ask you a little bit about\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Psychedelics and meditation", "output": "psychedelics because uh there's been a lot of excellent research on uh different psychedelics psilocybin mdma\nyeah even dmt drugs in general marijuana too\nuh what do you think psychedelics do to the human mind it seems they take\nthe human mind to some interesting places is that just a little uh hack\na visual hack or is there some profound expansion of the mind so let's see i i don't believe in magic\ni believe in that i believe in in science in\nin causality still let's say and then as i said like i think that the brain\nthat the our subjective experience of reality is uh\nwe live in the simulation run by our brain and the simulation that our brain runs\nthey can be very pleasant or very hellish drugs they are changing some hyper\nparameters of the simulation it is possible thanks to change of these hyper parameters to actually look back on your\nexperience and even see that the given things that we took for granted they are\nchangeable so they allow to have a amazing perspective there is also\nfor instance the fact that after dmt people can see the full movie inside of their head\ngives me further belief that the brain can generate that full movie that the brain is actually\nlearning the model of reality to such extent that it tries to predict what's going to happen next yeah very high\nresolution so it can replay realities actually extremely high resolution and it's also kind of interesting to me\nthat somehow there seems to be some similarity between\nthese uh drugs and meditation itself and i actually started even these days to\nthink about meditation as a psychedelic and do you practice meditation\ni i practice meditation i mean i once few times on the retreats and it feels after like after\nsecond or third day of meditation\nthere is a there is almost like a sense of you know tripping what does the meditation retreat entail\nso i mean you you wake up early in the morning and you meditate for extended\nperiod of time and alone yeah so it's optimized even though there\nare other people it's optimized for isolation so you don't speak with anyone you don't actually look into other\npeople's eyes and you know you sit on the chair and\nsay the passage meditation tells you uh to focus on the breath so you try to put\nall the all attention into breathing and breathing in and breathing out\nand the crazy thing is that as you focus attention like that\nafter some time their stamps starts coming back like some\nmemories that you completely forgotten it almost feels like um that you have a\nmailbox and then you you know you are just like a archiving email one by one\nand at some point at some point there is like a amazing feeling of getting to mailbox zero\nzero emails and uh it's very pleasant it's it's kind of it's it's\nit's crazy to me that that once\nyou resolve these inner stories or like inner traumas\nthen once there is nothing uh left the default state of human mind is\nextremely peaceful and happy extreme like some sense it it feels that\nit feels at least to me in the way how when i was a child that i can look at any object and\nit's very beautiful i have a lot of curiosity about the simple things and that's where usually meditation takes me\nare you what are you experiencing are you just taking in simple sensory\ninformation and they're just enjoying the rawness of that sensory information so there's no\nthere's no memories all that kind of stuff you're just enjoying being\nyeah pretty much i mean still there is a there it's it's thoughts are slowing\ndown sometimes they pop up but it's also somehow the extended meditation takes\nyou to the space that they are way more friendly you know way more positive um\nthere is also this uh this thing that we've actually\nit almost feels that the it almost feels that the we are\nconstantly getting a little bit of a reward function and we are just spreading this reward function on\nvarious activities but if you stay still for extended period of time it kind of\naccumulates accumulates accumulates and there is a there is a sense there is a\nsense that at some point it passes some threshold and it feels as\ndrop is falling into kind of ocean of love and bliss and that's like a this is like a very pleasant and as i'm\nsaying okay that corresponds to the subjective experience some people\nuh i guess in spiritual community they describe it that that's the reality and\ni would say i believe that they're like all sorts of subjective experience that one can have and\ni believe that for instance meditation might take you to the subjective experiences which are very pleasant collaborative and i would like a word to\nmove toward a more collaborative uh place\nyeah i would say that's very pleasant that i enjoy doing stuff like that i i i wonder how that maps to your uh\nmathematical model of love with the the reward function combining a bunch of things\nit seems like our life then is we're just we have this reward\nfunction and we're accumulating a bunch of stuff in it with weights\nit's like um like multi-objective and\nwhat meditation is is you just remove them remove them until the weight on one\nor just a few is is very high and that's where the pleasure comes from yeah so\nsomething similar how i'm thinking about this so i told you that there is like a\nthere is a story of who you are and i think almost about it as a you know text prepended to gpt\nyeah and some people refer to it as ego okay it's like a story\nwho who you are okay so ego is the prompt for gpt three gpg yes yes and\nthat's description of you and then with meditation you can get to the point that actually you experience things without\nthe prompt and you experience things like as they are you are not biased over the\ndescription how they supposed to be uh that's very pleasant and then with respect to the reward function uh it's\npossible to get to the point that the there is dissolution of self and therefore you can say that they are\nyou you're having a you're or like your brain attempts to simulate the reward function of everyone else or like\neverything that's there is this like a love which feels like a oneness with everything\nand that's also you know very beautiful very pleasant at some point you might have a lot of altruistic\nthoughts during that moment and then the self uh always comes back how would you recommend\nif somebody is interested in meditation like a big thing to take on as a project would you recommend a meditation retreat\nhow many days what kind of thing would you recommend i think that actually retreat is the way to go and it almost\nfeels that as i said like a meditation is a psychedelic but\nwhen you take it in the small dose you might barely feel it once you get the high dose actually you're gonna feel it\num so even cold turkey if you haven't really seriously meditated for a prolonged period of time just go to a\nretreat yeah how many days how many days start the weekend one weekend so like two three days\nand it's like it's interesting that first or second day it's hard and at\nsome point it becomes easy there's a lot of seconds in a day how hard is the meditation retreat just\nsitting there in a chair so the thing is actually\nit literally just depends on your uh on death your own framing like if you\nare in the mindset that you are waiting for it to be over or you are waiting for nirvana to happen it will be very\nunpleasant yeah and in some sense even the difficulty it's not even in\nthe lack of being able to speak with others like you are sitting there your\nlegs will hurt from sitting in terms of like the practical things do you experience kind of discomfort like\nphysical discomfort of just sitting like your your butt being numb your\nlegs being sore all that kind of stuff yes you experience it and then the they teach you to observe it\nrather and it's like a the crazy thing is you at first might have a feeling toward trying to escape it yeah and that\nbecomes very apparent that that's extremely unpleasant and then you just just observe it and\nat some point it it just becomes uh it just is it's like a i remember with ilya told me\nsome time ago that uh you know he takes a cold shower and his mindset of taking a court cold shower was to\nembrace suffering yeah excellent i do the same there's the art style yes my style\ni like this so my style is actually i also sometimes take cold showers it is purely observing\nhow the water goes through my body like a purely being present not trying to escape from there yeah and i would say\nthen it actually becomes pleasant it's not like ah well that that's\ninteresting um i i'm also that mean that's that's the\nway to deal with anything really difficult especially in the physical space is to observe it\nto say it's pleasant it's a i would use a different word\nyour uh you're accepting of the full beauty of\nreality i would say because say pleasant but yeah i mean in some sense it is\npleasant that's the only way to deal with a cold shower is to to become an observer and to find\njoy in it same with like really difficult physical uh exercise or like running for a really\nlong time endurance events just anytime you're exhausted any kind of pain i think the only way to survive\nit is not to resist it just to observe it you mentioned ilya elias discover\n"}

somebody you have technical discussions with on in space machine learning\ndeep learning ai but also life what's it like when these two uh agents\nget into a self-play situation in in a room what's it like collaborating with him\nso i believe that we have extreme uh respect to each other so\num i mean i love ilia's insight both like uh\ni guess about consciousness uh life ai but uh in terms of the it's interesting\nto me because you're a brilliant uh\nthinker in the space of machine learning like intuition like digging deep in what works\nwhat doesn't why it works why it doesn't and so is ilia i'm wondering if there's\ninteresting deep discussions you've had with him in the past or disagreements that were very\nproductive so i can say i also understood over the time where\nare my strengths so obviously we have plenty of ai discussions and\num and you know i myself have plenty of ideas but like i consider ilya\none of the most prolific ai scientists in the entire world and i think that\num i realized that maybe my super skill is being able to bring people to\ncollaborate together that i have some level of empathy that is unique in ai world and that might come you know from\neither meditation psychedelics or let's say i read just hundreds of books on this topic so and i also went through a\njourney of you know i develop all sorts of algorithms so i think that\nmaybe i can that's my super human skill uh\nilia is one of the best ai scientists but then i'm pretty good in assembling teams and\ni'm also not holding two people like i'm growing people and then people become managers that open yeah there's room any\nof them like a research manager so you you find you find places where you're excellent\nand and he finds like his his deep scientific insights is where he is and\nyou find ways you can the puzzle pieces fit together correct okay you know ultimately for instance\nlet's say ilia he doesn't manage people uh that's not what he likes or so um\ni i like i like hanging out with people by default i'm an extrovert and i care about people oh interesting okay\nokay cool so that that fits perfectly together but i i mean uh i also just like your intuition about various\nproblems in machine learning he's definitely one i really enjoy i remember talking to him\nabout something i was struggling with which is coming up with a good model for\npedestrians for human beings across the street in the context of autonomous vehicles\nand he immediately started to like formulate a framework within which you can evolve a model for pedestrians like\nthrough self-play all that kind of mechanisms the depth of thought on a particular\nproblem especially problems he doesn't know anything about is fascinating to watch it makes you realize like um\nyeah the the limits of the that the human intellect might be limitless\nor it's just impressive to see a descent on the vape come up with clever ideas yeah i mean so even in the space of deep\nlearning when you look at various people there are people you know who invented\nsome breakthroughs once but there are very few people who did it multiple times and you can think if someone\ninvented it once that might be just a shared luck and if someone invented it multiple\ntimes you know if a probability of inventing it once is one over a million then probability of inventing it twice\nor three times would be one over a million square or to the power of three which which would be just impossible so\nit literally means that it's it's given that uh it's not the luck yeah and ilea\nis one of these few people who um who have uh a lot of these inventions in\nhis arsenal it also feels that the now for instance if you think about folks like gauss or euler\nand you know at first they read a lot of books and then they did thinking and then they\nfigure out math and that's how it feels with ilya yeah you know at first he read stuff and then\nlike he spent his thinking cycles and that's a really good way to put it\nwhen i talk to him [Music] i i see thinking\nhe's actually thinking like he makes me realize that there's like deep thinking that the human mind\ncan do like most of us are not thinking deeply like you really have to put a lot of\neffort to think deeply like i have to really put myself in a place where i think deeply about a problem it takes a\nlot of effort it's like a it's like an airplane taking off or something you have to achieve deep focus he he's just\nuh he's what is it his brain is like a vertical takeoff\nin terms of airplane analogy so it's interesting but it i mean cal newport talks about this\nas ideas of deep work it's you know most of us don't work much at all in terms of like\nlike deeply think about particular problems whether it's math engineering all that kind of stuff\nyou want to go to that place often and that's real hard work and some of us are better than others at that so i think\nthat the big piece has to do with actually even engineering your environment such that it's conducive to\nthat yeah so um see both ilia and i uh on the frequent\nbasis we kind of disconnect ourselves from the world in order to be able to do extensive amount of thinking yes so ilia\nusually he just leaves ipad at hand he loves his ipad\nand for me i'm even sometimes you know just going for a few days to different location to airbnb i'm\nturning off my phone and there is no access to me yeah and\nthat's extremely important for me to be able to actually just formulate new thoughts to do deep work rather than to\nbe reactive and the the older i am the more

{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "How does GPT work?", "output": "to our friend gpt let me ask you another ridiculously big question\ncan you give an overview of what gpt 3 is or like you say in your twitter bio gpt\nn plus one how it works and why it works so um gpt 3 is a\nhumongous neural network and let's assume that we know what is neural network okay by the definition\nand it is trained on the entire internet and just to predict\nnext word so let's say it sees part of the uh article and it the only task that\nit has at hand it is to say what would be the next word uh what would be the next word\nand it becomes uh really exceptional at the task of figuring out what's the next word so you\nmight ask why would this be an important task why\nwould it be important to predict what's the next word and it turns out that a lot of problems\nuh can be formulated uh as a text completion problem so gpt is\npurely uh learning to complete the text and you could imagine for instance if you are asking a question who is a\npresident of united states then gpt can give you an answer to it it turns out that many more things can\nbe formulated this way you can format text in the way that you have sentence in english\nyou make it even look like a some content of a website uh elsewhere which would be teaching people how to\ntranslate things between languages so it would be en colon text in english fr colon and then you uh\nand then you ask people and then you ask model to to continue and it turns out that the such a model is predicting\ntranslation from english to french the crazy thing is that\nthis model can be used for way more sophisticated tasks so you can format text such that\nit looks like a conversation between two people and that might be a conversation between you and elon musk and because\nthe model read all the texts about elon musk it will be able to predict elon musk\nwords as it would be elon musk it will speak about colonization of mars about sustainable future and so on and\nit's also possible to to even give arbitrary personality to\nthe model you can say here is a conversation with a friendly ai bot\nand the model uh will complete the text as a friendly ai bot so i mean\nhow do i express how amazing this is so just to clarify\na conversation generating a conversation between me and elon musk it wouldn't just generate good\nexamples of what elon would say it would get the syntax all correct so like interview style you would say like\nelon colon and lex con like it it's not just like uh inklings of\nsemantic correctness it's like the whole thing grammatical\nsyntactic semantic it's just really really impressive\nuh generalization yeah i mean i also want to you know provide some caveats so it can generate\nfew paragraphs of coherent text but as you go to uh longer pieces it actually\ngoes off the rails okay if you would uh try to write a book it won't work out uh this way what way does it go off the\nrails by the way is there interesting ways in which it goes off the rails like what falls apart first so the model is\ntrained on the all the existing data that is out there which means that it is\nnot trained on its own mistakes so for instance if it would make a mistake then\nuh i kept so to give give you an example so let's say i have a conversation with\na model pretending that is elon musk and then i start putting some i'm start\nactually making up things which are not factual um i would say like twitter\nbut i gotcha sorry yeah um okay i don't know i would say that elon is my\nwife and the model will just keep on carrying it on and as if it's\ntrue yes and in some sense if you would have a normal conversation with elon he would\nbe what the [ __ ] yeah there would be some feedback between so the the model is trained on\nthings that humans have written but through the generation process there's no human in the loop feedback correct\nthat's fascinating makes sense so it's magnified it's like the errors get magnified and magnified right and it's a\nit's also interesting i mean first of all humans have the same problem it's just that we\nuh we make fewer errors and magnify the errors slower i think that actually what\nhappens with humans is if you have a wrong belief about the world as a kid then very quickly you will learn that\nit's not correct because you are grounded in reality and you are learning from your new experience yes\nbut do you think the model can correct itself too it through the power of the\nrepresentation and so the absence of elon musk being your wife\ninformation on the internet want to correct itself there won't be examples like that so the\nerrors would be subtle at first saddle at first and in some sense\nyou can also say that the data that is not out there is the data which would represent how the human learns\nthat's an a and and maybe model would be trained on such a data then it would be better off how intelligent is gpt 3 do\nyou think like when you think about the nature of intelligence it seems exceptionally\nimpressive but then if you think about the big agi problem is this footsteps along the way\nto agi so let's see seems that intelligence itself is there are multiple axis of it and\ni would expect that the the systems that we are building they\nmay end up being super human on some axis and sub human on some other axis it\nwould be surprising to me on all axis simultaneously they would become superhuman\nof course people ask this question is gpt a spaceship that that would take us to moon or are we\nputting a building a ladder to heaven that we are just building bigger and bigger ladder and we don't know in some\nsense uh which one of these two which one is better\ni'm trying to i like stairway to heaven that's a good song so i'm not exactly sure which one is better but you're\nsaying like the the spaceship to the moon is actually effective correct so people who criticize gpt yeah\nthey say jarga is just building a taller a ladder\nand it will never reach the moon and at the moment i would say the way i'm\nthinking is this like a scientific question and i'm also in heart i'm a builder\ncreator and like i'm thinking let's try out let's see how far it goes and so far\nwe see constantly that there is a progress yeah so what do you think\ngpt4 gpt5 gpt n plus one\nwill uh there'll be a phase shift like a transition to a to a place where\nwe'll be truly surprised then again like gpt3 is already very like truly surprising the people that criticize\ngpg3 as it's there as a what is it ladder to heaven i think too quickly get accustomed to\nhow impressive it is that the prediction of the next word can achieve such\ndepth of semantics accuracy of syntax grammar and semantics\num do you do you think gpt four and five and six will continue\nto surprise us i mean definitely there will be more impressive models there is a question of\ncourse if there will be a phase shift and\nthe also even the way i'm thinking about the about these models is that when we build these models\nyou know we see some level of the capabilities but we don't even fully understand everything that the model can\ndo and actually one of the best things to do is to allow other people to probe the model to\neven see what is possible hence the using gpg as an api\nand opening it up to the world yeah i mean so when i'm thinking from perspective of\nthere like a obviously various people are that have concerns about agi including myself\nand then when i'm thinking from perspective what's the strategy even to deploy these things to the world\nthe the one strategy that i have seen many times working is the iterative deployment that you deploy\num slightly better versions and you allow other people to criticize you so you actually are tried out you see where\nare their fundamental issues and it's almost you don't want to be in that situation that you are holding into\npowerful system and there's like a huge overhang then you deploy it and it might have a random chaotic impact on the\nworld so you actually want to be in the situation that they are gradually deploying systems\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "AI safety", "output": "i asked this question of ilio let me ask you you this question i've been reading a lot\nabout stalin and power\nif you're in possession of a system that's like agi that's exceptionally powerful\ndo you think your character integrity might become corrupted like famously power corrupts and\nabsolute power corrupts absolutely so i believe that you want at some point to\nwork toward distributing the power i think that you want to be in the situation\nthat actually agi is not controlled by a small number of people but\nessentially by a larger collective so the thing is that requires a george washington style\nmove in the ascent to power there's always a moment when somebody gets a lot of power\nand they have to have the integrity and uh the moral compass to give away\nthat power that humans have been good and bad throughout history at this\nparticular step and i wonder i wonder we like blind ourselves in uh\nfor example between nations a race uh towards uh\nyeah ai race between nations we might blind ourselves and justify to ourselves the development of ai without\ndistributing the power because we want to defend ourselves against china against russia that kind\nof that kind of logic and i wonder how we um\nhow we design governance mechanisms that um prevent us from\nbecoming power hungry and in the process destroying ourselves so let's see i have been thinking about\nthis topic quite a bit but i also want to admit that uh once again i actually want to rely\nway more on sam outman on it hero than a heroed an excellent block\non how even to distribute wealth and his proper he proposed in his block\nto tax equity of the companies rather than profit and to distribute it and this is\nthis is an example of uh washington move\ni guess i personally have insane trust in some he already spent plenty of money running\na universal basic income project that like gives me i guess\nmaybe some level of trust to him but i also i guess\nlove him as a friend yeah i wonder because we're sort of summoning a new set of technologies\ni wonder if we'll be cognizant like you're describing the process of open ai but it could also be\nat other places like in the us government right both china and the us are now\nfull steam ahead on autonomous weapons systems development and that's really worrying to me because\nin the framework of something being a national security danger or military\ndanger you can do a lot of pretty dark things that blind our moral compass\nand i think ai will be one of those things in some sense the the mission\nand the work you're doing at openai is like the counterbalance to that so you want to have more open ai and less\nautonomous weapon systems i i i like these statements like to be clear like this interesting and i'm thinking about\nit myself but uh this is a place that i i okay i put my trust actually\nin some hence because it's extremely hard for me to reason about it yeah i mean one important statement to make is\num it's good to think about this yeah no question about right no question even\nlike low-level quote-unquote engineer like there's such a\ni remember i i programmed a car uh our rc car\nthey went really fast like 30 40 miles an hour and i remember i was like sleep deprived\nso i programmed it pretty crappily and it like uh the the code froze so it's doing some\nbasic computer vision and it's going around on track but it's going full speed\nand uh there's a bug in the code that uh the car just went it didn't turn it went straight\nfull speed and smashed into the wall i remember thinking the seriousness with which you need to\napproach the design of artificial intelligence systems and the programming of artificial intelligence systems\nis high because the consequences are high like that little car smashing it to the wall\nfor some reason i immediately thought of like an algorithm that controls nuclear weapons\nhaving the same kind of bug and so like the lowest level engineer and the ceo of a company all need to have the\nseriousness in approaching this problem and thinking about the worst case consequences so i\nthink that is true i mean the what i also recognize in myself and\nothers even asking this question is that it evokes a lot of fear and fear itself ends up being actually\nquite debilitating the place where i arrived at the moment\nmight sound cheesy or so but it's almost to build things out of love rather than\nfear yeah i can focus on how i can you know maximize the value how\nthe systems that i'm building might be uh useful i'm not saying that the fear doesn't\nexist out there and like it totally makes sense to minimize it but i don't want to be working because\nuh i'm scared i want to be working out of passion out of curiosity out of the\nyou know looking forward for the positive future with uh the definition of love arising from a\nrigorous practice of empathy so not just like your own conception of what is good for the world but uh always listening to\nothers correct like at the love where i'm considering reward functions of others\nothers to infil limit to infinity is like a sum like one to n where n is uh seven\nbillion or whatever it is not not projecting my reward functions on others yeah exactly okay\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "OpenAI Codex", "output": "can we just take a step back to something else super cool which is uh opening up codex\ncan you give an overview of what open-air codecs and github co-pilot is\nhow it works and why the hell it works so well so with gpd3 we noticed that the\nsystem um you know that system training all the language out there started having some\nrudimentary coding capabilities so we're able to ask it you know to\nimplement addition function between two numbers and indeed it can write python or javascript code for that and then we\nthought um we might as well just go full steam ahead and try to create a system\nthat is actually good at what we are doing every day ourselves which is programming\nwe optimize models for proficiency in coding we actually even created models that both have a\ncomprehension of language and code and codex is api for these models so\nit's first pre-trained on language and then i don't know if you can say fine-tuned\nbecause there's a lot of code but it's language and code it's language and code\nit's also optimized for various things like let's say low latency and so on codex is the api that's similar to gpd3\nwe expect that there will be proliferation of the potential products that can use coding capabilities and i\ncan i can speak about it in a second compiled is the first product\nand developed by github so as we're building uh models we wanted to make sure that these models are useful\nand we work together with github on building the first product co-pilot is actually as you code it suggests you\ncode completions and we have seen in the past they're like a various tools that can suggest how to like a few characters\nof the code or the line of code the the thing about copilot is it can generate 10 lines of code you\nit's often the way how it works is you often write in the comment what you want to happen because\npeople in comments they describe what happens next so um these days when i code instead of\ngoing to google to search for the appropriate code to solve my problem i say oh for this array could\nyou smooth it and then you know it imports some appropriate libraries and say it uses numpy convolution or so i\nthat i was not even aware that exists and it does the appropriate thing um so you you write a comment maybe the\nheader of a function and it completes the function of course you don't know what is the space of all the possible\nsmall programs it can generate what are the failure cases how many edge cases how many subtle\nerrors there are how many big errors there are it's hard to know but the fact that it works at all on in a large\nnumber of cases is incredible it's like a it's a kind of search engine\ninto code that's been written on the internet correct so for instance when you search things online then\nusually you get to the some particular case like if you go to stack overflow\npeople describe that one particular situation uh and then they seek for a\nsolution but in case of uh co-pilot it's aware of your entire context and in\ncontexts oh these are the libraries that they are using that's the set of the variables that is initialized and on the\nspot it can actually tell you what to do so the interesting thing is and we think that the copilot is one\npossible product using codex but there is a place for many more so internally we tried out you know to\ncreate other fun products so it turns out that a lot of tools out there\nlet's say google calendar or microsoft word or so they all have uh internal api to build\nplugins around them so there is a way in the sophisticated way to control calendar or microsoft\nword today if you want if you want more complicated behaviors from these programs you have to add a\nnew button for every behavior but it is possible to use codex and\ntell for instance to calendar could you schedule an appointment with\nblacks next week after 2 pm and either writes corresponding piece of code\nand that's the thing that actually you want so interesting so what you figure out is there's a lot of\nprograms with which you can interact through code and so there you can generate that code\nfrom natural language that's fascinating and that's somewhat like also closest to\nuh what was the promise of siri or alexa yeah so previously all these behaviors they were had\nhard coded yeah and it seems that codex on the fly can pick up the api of let's\nsay given software yeah and then it can turn the language into use of this api without hard coding you can find it can\ntranslate to machine language correct it to uh so for example this would be really exciting for me like for um adobe\nproducts like photoshop uh which is the i think actionscript i think there's a scripting language that\ncommunicates with them same with premiere and you could imagine that that allows event to\ndo coding by voice on your phone so for instance in the past okay as of\ntoday i'm not editing word documents on my phone because it's just the keyboard\nis too small but if i would be able to tell to my phone you know uh make the header\nlarge and then move the paragraphs around and it does actually what i want so i can tell you one more cool thing or\neven how i'm thinking about codex so if you look actually at the evolution\nof of computers we started with very primitive\ninterfaces which is a punch card and punch card essentially you make a holes in the\nin the plastic card to indicate zeros and ones and during that time there was a small\nnumber of specialists who were able to use computers and by the way people even suspected that there is no need for many\nmore people to use computers but then we moved from punch cards to\nat first assembly then c and these programming languages they were slightly higher level they allowed\nmany more people to code and they also led to more of a proliferation of\ntechnology and you know further on there was a jump to say from c plus plus to java and python\nand every time it has happened more people are able to code and we build more technology and it's even you\nknow hard to imagine now if someone will tell you that you should write code in\nassembly instead of let's say python or or or java or javascript and codex is yet\nanother step toward kind of bringing computers closer to humans such that you communicate with a computer\nwith your own language rather than with a specialized language and i think that it will lead to\nan increase of number of people who can code yeah and then and the kind of technologies that those people will\ncreate is like it's innumerable it could you know it could be a huge number of technologies we're not predicting at all\nbecause that's less and less requirement of uh having a technical mind a programming mind you're not opening it\nto the world of um other kinds of minds creative minds\nartistic minds all that kind of stuff i would like for instance biologists who work on dna to be able to program and\nnot to need to spend a lot of time uh learning it and i i believe that's a good thing to the word and i would\nactually add out that so at the moment i'm a managing codex team and also\nlanguage team and i believe that there is like a plenty of brilliant people out there and they should apply\noh okay yeah awesome so what's the language in the codexes so those are kind of they're overlapping teams so it's like\ngpt the raw language and then the codex is like applied to programming\ncorrect and they are quite intertwined there are many more teams involved making these uh\nmodels extremely efficient and deployable for instance there are people who are working to you know\nmake our data centers uh amazing or there are people who work on pro putting these models into production\nor uh or even pushing it at the very limit of the scale\nso all aspects from from the infrastructure to the actual machine learning so i'm just saying that multiple teams while the\nand the team working on codex and language uh i guess i'm i'm directly managing them i would like i would love\nto hire yeah if you're interested in machine learning this is probably one of the most exciting uh problems and like systems to\nbe working on because it's actually it's it's pretty cool like what what uh the\nprogram synthesis like generating of programs is very interesting very interesting problem that has echoes of\nreasoning and intelligence in it it and i think there's a lot of fundamental questions that you might be\nable to sneak sneak up to by generating programs yeah\nthe one more exciting thing about the programs is that so i said that the um you know the in case of language that\none of the troubles is even evaluating language so when the things are made up you you need somehow\neither a human to say that this doesn't make sense or so in case of program there is one extra\nlevel that we can actually execute programs and see what they evaluate to so that process might be somewhat\nmore automated in in order to improve the uh qualities of generations and\nthat's not saying so like the wow that's really interesting so for the language that you know the simulation to actually\nexecute it as a human mind yeah for programs there is a there is a computer\non which you can evaluate it wow that's a brilliant little\ninsight that the thing compiles and runs that's first\nand second you can evaluate on a like do automated unit testing\nand in some sense it seems to me that we will be able to make a tremendous progress you know\nwe are in the paradigm that there is way more data and there is like a\ntranscription of millions of uh of uh software engineers yeah\nyeah so i mean you just me because i was going to ask you about reliability the thing\nabout programs is you don't know if they're going to like a program that's controlling a\nnuclear power plant has to be very reliable so i i wouldn't start with controlling nuclear power plant can i be\none day but that that's not actually that's not on the current roadmap that's not that's step one and you know it's\nthe russian thing you just want to go to the most powerful destructive thing right away run by javascript but i got you so it's\na lower impact but nevertheless what you're making me realize it is possible to achieve some levels of\nreliability by doing testing and i thought you could imagine that them you know maybe there are ways for a\nmodel to write even code for testing itself and so on and there exists a ways to create the\nfeedback loops that the model could keep on improving\nby writing programs that generate tests for the instance for instance\nand that's how we get consciousness because it's meta compression that's what you're going to write that's the\ncomment that's the prompt that generates consciousness compressor of compressors you just write\nthat do you think the code that generates consciousness would be simple\nso let's see i mean ultimately the core idea behind will be simple but there\nwill be also decent amount of engineering involved like in some sense\nit seems that you know spreading these models on many machines and it's not that trivial yeah and\nwe find all sorts of innovations that make our models more efficient\ni believe that first models that i guess are conscious are like a\ntruly intelligent they will have all sorts of tricks\nbut then again there's uh which is certain argument that maybe the tricks are temporary thing yeah they\nmight be temporary things and in some sense it's also even important to um\nto know that even the cost of a trick so sometimes people are eager to put the\ntrick while forgetting that there is a cost of maintenance or like a long-term cost long-term cost\nor maintenance or maybe even flexibility of code to actually implement new ideas so even if you have\nsomething that gives you 2x but it requires you know 1000 lines of code i'm not sure if it's actually worth it so in\nsome sense you know if it's five lines of code and 2x i would take it\nand and we we we see many of this but also you know that requires some level\nof i guess lack of attachment to code that we are willing to remove it yeah\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Robotics", "output": "so you led the open ai robotics team can you give an overview of of the cool\nthings you're able to accomplish what are you most proud of so when we started robotics we knew that actually reinforcement learning works\nand it is possible to solve very complicated problems like for instance alphago is an evidence\nthat it is possible to to build superhuman and gold players dota 2 is a\nan evidence that is possible to build superhuman uh\nagents playing dota so i asked myself a question you know what about robots out there could we train machines to solve\narbitrary tasks in the physical world our approach was i guess let's pick a\ncomplicated problem that if we would solve it that means that we made some uh significant progress in the\ndomain and then we went after the problem so um we noticed that actually the\nrobots out there they are kind of at the moment optimized per task so you can have a robot that it's like if you have\na robot opening a battle it's very likely that the end factor is a battle opener\nand and in some sense that's a hack to be able to solve a task which makes any task easier and um ask myself so what\nwould be a robot that can actually solve many tasks yeah and we conclude that that\nlike a human hands have such a quality that indeed they are you know you have\nfive kind of tiny arms attached individually they can manipulate\npretty broad spectrum of objects so we went after a single hand like a trying\nto solve rubik's cube single-handed we picked this task because we thought that there is no way to\nharcode it and it's also we picked the robot on which it would be hard to hardcode it and\nwe went after the solution such that it could generalize to other problems and just to clarify it's\none robotic hand solving the rubik's cube the hard part isn't the solution to the rubik's cube is the manipulation of\nthe uh of like having it not fall out of the hand having it use the uh\nfive baby arms to uh what is it like rotate different parts of the rubik's cube to achieve the\nsolution correct yeah so what uh what was the hardest part about that\nwhat was the approach taken there what are you most proud of obviously we have like a strong belief in reinforcement\nlearning and uh you know one path it is to do reinforcement learning the real world\nother path is to the simulation in some sense the tricky part about the real world is at\nthe moment our models they require a lot of data there is essentially no data\nand i did we decided to go through the path of the simulation and in simulation\nyou can have infinite amount of data the tricky part is the fidelity of the simulation and also can you in\nsimulation represent everything that you represent otherwise in the real world and you know it turned out that uh\nthat you know because there is lack of fidelity it is possible to that what we\nwhat we arrived at is training a model that doesn't solve one simulation but it\nactually solves the entire range of simulations which uh vary uh in terms of like uh what's the\nexactly the friction of that cube or the weight or so and the single ai that can solve all of them\nends up working well with the reality how do you generate the different simulations so\nyou know there's plenty of parameters out there we just pick them randomly and and in simulation model just goes for\nthousands of years and keeps on solving rubik's cube in each of them and the thing is the neural network that we used\nit has a memory and as it presses for instance the side\nof the of the cube it can sense oh that's actually this side was\nuh difficult to press i should press it stronger and throughout this process kind of\nlearns even how to how to solve this particular instance of the rubik's cube back even mass it's\nkind of like a you know sometimes when you go to a gym and after\nafter bench press you try to lift the\nand you kind of forgot uh and and your hand goes like yeah right away because\nkind of you got this to maybe different weight yeah and it takes a second to adjust yeah\nand this kind of of a memory that model gained through the process of interacting with the cube in the\nsimulation i appreciate you speaking to the audience with the bench press all the bros in the audience\nprobably working out right now there's probably somebody listening to this actually doing bench press\nso maybe uh put the bar down and pick up the water bottle and you'll know exactly\nwhat uh what check is talking about okay so what uh\nwhat was the hardest part of getting the whole thing to work so the hardest part is\nat the moment when it comes to a physical world when it comes to robots\nthey require maintenance it's hard to replicate a million times it's\nit's also it's hard to replay things exactly i remember this situation that\none guy at our company he had like a model that performs way better than other models in\nsolving rubik's cube and you know we kind of didn't know what's going on\nwhy it's that and it turned out that you know he was running it from his\nlaptop that had better cpu or uh or better or maybe local gpu as well\nand uh because of that there was less of a latency and the model was the same\nand that actually made solving rubik's cube more reliable so in some sense there might be some\nsaddlebacks like that when it comes to running things in the real world even hinting on that\nyou could imagine that the initial models you would like to have models which are insanely huge neural networks\nand you would like to give them even more time for thinking and when you have these real-time\nsystems then you might be constrained actually by the amount of latency\nand ultimately i would like to build the system that it is worth for you to wait five minutes\nbecause it gives you the answer that you are willing to wait for five minutes so latency is a very unpleasant\nconstraint underwish to operate correct and also there is actually one more thing which is tricky about robots\nthere is actually no not much data so the data that i'm speaking about would be a data of\nfirst person experience from the robot and like a gigabytes of data like that if we would have gigabytes of data like\nthat of robot solving various problems it would be very easy to make a progress on robotics and you can see that in case\nof text or code there is a lot of data like a first person perspective data on the writing code\nyeah so you had this you mentioned this really interesting idea that\nif you were to build like a successful robotics company so open as mission is much bigger than robotics this is one of\nthe one of the things you've worked on but if it was a robotics company they\nyou wouldn't so quickly dismiss supervised learning i correct that you would build a robot\nthat was perhaps one like um an empty shell like dumb and they\nwould operate under tele operation so you would invest that's just one way to do it invest in\nhuman super like direct human control of the robots as it's learning and over time add more and more automation\nthat's correct so let's say that's how i would build a robotics company today if i would be building a robotics\ncompany which is you know spent 10 million dollars or so recording human trajectories controlling\na robot after you find a thing that the robot should be doing\nthat there's a market fit for like that you can make a lot of money with that product correct correct yeah\nso i would record data and then i would essentially train supervised learning model on it\nthat might be the path today long term i think that actually what is needed is to train powerful models over\nvideo so um you have seen maybe a models that can generate images like dali\nand people are looking into models generating videos they're like various algorithmic questions even how to do it\nand it's unclear if there is enough compute for this purpose but i i suspect that the models that which\nwould have a level of understanding of video same as gpt has the level of understanding of\ntext could be used to train robots to solve tasks they\nwould have a lot of common sense if one day i'm pretty sure one day\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Developing self driving cars and robots", "output": "there will be a robotics company by robotics company i mean the primary\nsource of income is is from robots that is worth over\n1 trillion dollars what do you think that company will do i think self-driving cars no\nit's interesting because my mind went to personal robotics robots in the home it seems like there's much more market\nopportunity there i think it's very difficult to achieve\ni mean this this this might speak to something important which is i understand self-driving much\nbetter than understand robotics in the home so i understand how difficult it is to actually solve self-driving\nto uh to a level not just the actual computer vision and the control problem and just the basic problem self-driving\nbut creating a product that would undeniably be um\nthat will cost less money like it will save you a lot of money like orders the magnitude less money that could replace\nuber drivers for example so car sharing that's autonomous that creates a similar or better experience in terms\nof how quickly you get from a to b or just whatever the the pleasantness of the experience\nthe efficiency of the experience the value of the experience and at the same time the car itself costs cheaper\ni think that's very difficult to achieve i think there's a lot more um low hanging fruit in the home\nthat that could be i also want to give you perspective on like how challenging it would be at home\nor like it maybe kind of depends on the exact problem that you'd be solving okay if we are speaking about these robotic\narms and hence these things they cost tens of thousands of dollars or maybe 100k\nand you know maybe obviously maybe there would be economy of scale these things\nwould be cheaper but actually for any household to buy the price would have to go down to maybe\nthousand bucks yeah i personally think that uh\nso self-driving car it provides a clear service i don't think robots in the home\nthey'll be a trillion dollar company will just be all about service meaning it will not necessarily be about\nlike a robotic arm that helps you i don't know open a bottle\nor wash the dishes or any of that kind of stuff it has to be able to take care of that whole the\ntherapist thing you mentioned i i think that's um of course there's a line between what is a robot and what is\nnot like doesn't really need a body but you know some uh ai system with some embodiment i\nthink so the tricky part when you think actually what's the difficult part is um\nwhen the robot has like when there is a diversity of the environment with which the robot has to\ninteract that becomes hard so you know on one spectrum you have industrial robots as they are doing over\nand over the same thing it is possible to some extent to prescribe the movements and with very small amount of\nintelligence the the movement can be repeated millions of times um the it\nthere are also you know various pieces of industrial robots where it becomes harder and harder like for instance in\ncase of tesla it might be a matter of putting a a rack inside of a car\nand you know because the rack kind of moves around it's it's not that easy it's not exactly the same every time it\nends up being the case that you need actually humans to do it and while you know welding cars together\nit's a very repetitive process and then in case of self-driving itself\nthe difficulty has to do with the diversity of the environment but still\nthe car itself and the problem that you are solving is you try to avoid even interacting with\nthings you are not touching anything around because touching itself is hard and then if you would have in the home\nuh robot that you know has to touch things and like if these things they change the shape if there is a huge\nvariety of things to be touched then that's difficult if you are speaking about the robot which there is you know\nhead that is smiling in some way with cameras that it doesn't you know touch things that's relatively simple\nokay so to both agree and to push back so you're referring to touch like\nsoft robotics like the actual touch but i would argue that you could formulate\njust basic interaction between um like non-contact interaction\nis also a kind of touch and that might be very difficult to solve that's the basic this not disagreement but that's\nthe basic open question to me with self-driving cars and disagreement with elon which is how much interaction\nis required to solve self-driving cars how much touch is required you said that\nin your intuition touch is not required and my intuition to create a product\nthat's compelling to use you're going to have to uh interact with pedestrians not just avoid\npedestrians but interact with them when we drive around in major cities\nwe're constantly threatening everybody's life with our movements and that's how they respect us there's a\ngame theoretically going on with pedestrians and i am afraid you can't just\nformulate autonomous driving as a collision avoidance problem so i i think it goes\nbeyond like a collision avoidance is the first order approximation but then at least in case of tesla they\nare gathering data from people driving their cars and i believe that's an example of supervised learning data that they can\ntrain their models uh on and they are doing it which you know can give the model this\nlike another level of of a behavior that is needed to actually\ninteract with the real world yeah it's interesting how much data is required to achieve that\num what do you think of the whole tesla autopilot approach the computer vision based approach with multiple cameras and\nthere's a data engine it's a multi-task multi-headed neural network and it's this fascinating process of uh similar\nto what you're talking about with the the robotics approach uh which is you know you deploy neural\nnetwork and then there's humans that use it and then it runs into trouble in a bunch of places and that stuff is sent back so\nlike the deployment discovers a bunch of edge cases and those edge cases are sent back\nfor supervised annotation thereby improving the neural network and that's deployed again\nit goes over and over until the the network becomes really good at the task of driving becomes safer and safer what\ndo you think of that kind of approach to robotics i believe that's the way to go so in some sense even when i was\nspeaking about you know collecting trajectories from humans that's like a first step and then you deploy the\nsystem and then you have humans revising the all the issues and in some sense\nlike this approach converges to system that doesn't make mistakes because for the cases where there are mistakes you\ngot their data how to fix them and the system will keep on improving so there's a very\nto me difficult question of how hard that you know how long that converging takes how hard it is\nuh the other aspect of autonomous vehicles this probably applies to certain robotics applications\nis society right they put as as the quality of the system\nconverges so one there's a human factors perspective of psychology of humans being able to supervise those uh even\nwith teleoperation those robots and the other society willing to accept robots\ncurrently society is much harsher on self-driving cars than it is on human driven cars in terms of the expectation\nof safety so the bar is set much higher than for humans and we're so if there's\na death in an autonomous vehicle that's seen as much more\nmuch more dramatic than a death in a human driven vehicle part of the success of deployment of\nrobots is figuring out how to make robots part of society both on the just\nthe human side on the media journalist side and also on the policy government side and that seems to be uh\nmaybe you can put that into the objective function to optimize but that is that is definitely um\na tricky one and i wonder if that is actually the trickiest part for self-driving cars or any system that's\nsafety critical it's not the algorithm it's the society accepting it\nyeah i i would say i believe that the part of the process of deployment is\nactually showing people that the given things can be trusted yeah and you know\ntrust is also like a glass that is actually really easy to crack it yeah\nand damage it and i think that's actually very common with uh\nwith innovation that there is some resistance toward it yeah and\nit's just the natural progression so in some sense people will have to keep on proving that indeed these systems are\nworth being used and i would say i also found out that\noften the best way to convince people is by letting them experience it yeah\nabsolutely that's the case for tesla autopilot for example that's the case with uh yeah with\nbasically robots in general it's it's kind of funny to hear people talk about robots like\nthere's a lot of fear even like legged robots but when they actually interact with them\nthere's joy i love interacting with them and the same with the car with the robot\nif it starts being useful i think people immediately understand and if the product is designed well they\nfall in love you're right it's actually even similar when i'm thinking about co-pilot the github\nco-pilot there was a spectrum of responses that people had and uh ultimately\nuh the important piece was to let people try it out and then many people just\nloved it especially like programmers yeah programmers but like some of them you know they came with a\nfear yeah but then you try it out and you think actually that's cool okay and you know you can try to resist the same way\nas you know you could resist moving from punch cards to let's say\nc plus or so and it's a little bit futile\n"}

let's see we know that there are people who met\neach other online and they felt in love yeah so it seems that it's conceivable to\nestablish connection which is purely through internet\nand of course it might be more compelling than more modalities you add\nso it would be like you're proposing like a tinder but for ai are you like swipe right and left and\nhalf the systems are ai and the other is

just visual right it's also attractiveness with wit and humor and uh whatever\nwhatever makes conversations pleasant for humans\nokay all right um so so you're saying uh it's possible to\nachieve in the digital space in some sense i would almost ask that question why wouldn't that be possible\nright well i have this argument with my dad all the time he thinks that touch and smell are\nreally important so they can be very important and i'm saying the initial systems they won't\nhave it still i wouldn't like their people being born\nwithout these senses and you know i believe that they can still fall in love and have meaningful life\nyeah i wonder if it's uh possible to go close to all the way by just training on\ntranscripts of conversations like i wonder how far that takes us so i i think that actually still you want\nimages like i would like so i don't have kids but like i could imagine the having ai tutor it has to see you know\nkids drawing some pictures on their paper and and also facial expressions and all\nthat kind of stuff we use uh dogs and humans use their eyes and uh to communicate with each other i\nthink this that's that's a really powerful mechanism of communication body language too that uh words are much uh lower\nbandwidth and for body language we still you know we kind of have a system that displays an image\nof its or facial expression on the computer it doesn't have to move you know mechanical pieces or so so i think\nthat uh you know there is like kind of a progression you can imagine that text might be the simplest to tackle\nbut this is not a complete human experience at all you expand it to\nlet's say images both for input and output and what you describe is actually the final\ni guess frontier what makes us human the fact that we can touch each other or smell or so and it's the hardest from\nperspective of data and deployment and i okay i believe that these things might\nhappen gradually are you excited by that possibility this particular application of\nhuman to ai friendship and interaction so let's see\nlike would you uh do you look forward to a world you you said you're living with a few folks and you're very close\nfriends with them do you look forward to a day where one or two of those friends are ai systems so if the system would be truly wishing\nme well rather than being in the situation that it optimizes for my time to interact\nwith the system the line between those is it's a gray\nit's a gray area i i think that's the distinction between love and possession and these things\nthey might be often correlated for humans but it's it like like a you you\nmight find that there like some friends with whom you haven't spoken for months yeah and then you know you pick up the\nphone it's as the time hasn't passed they are not holding to you\nand i will i wouldn't like to have ai system that you know it's it's\ntrying to convince me to spend time with it i would like the system to optimize\nfor what i care about and help me in achieving my own goals\nbut there's some i mean i don't know there's some manipulation there's some possessiveness there's some insecurities\nthis fragility all those things are necessary to form a close friendship over time to\ngo through some dark [ __ ] together some bliss and happiness together i feel like\nthere's a lot of greedy self-centered behavior within that process my intuition but i might be wrong is\nthat human computer interaction doesn't have to go through uh\ncomputer being greedy possessive and so on it is possible to train systems maybe\nthat they actually you know they are i guess prompted or fine-tuned or so\nto truly optimize for what you care about and you could imagine that you know\nthat the way how the process would look like is at some point\nwe as a human as we look at the transcript of the conversation or like an entire interaction and we say\nactually here there was more loving way to go about it and we supervise system\ntoward being more loving or maybe we train the system such that it has a reward function toward being\nmore loving yeah or maybe the possibility of the system being an [ __ ]\nand manipulative and possessive every once in a while is a feature not a bug\nbecause some of the happiness that we experience when two\nsouls meet each other when two humans meet each other is a kind of break from the [ __ ] in the world\nand so you need [ __ ] and ai as well because like it'll be like a breath of fresh air to\ndiscover an ai that the three previous ais you had are too\nfriendly or no no or or cruel or whatever it's like some kind of mix\nand then this one is just right but you need to experience the full spectrum like i think you need to be able to\nengineer [ __ ] so let's see\nbecause there's some level to us of being appreciate to appreciate the human\nexperience we need the dark and the light so that kind of reminds me\num i met a while ago at the meditation retreat uh one woman and\num you know beautiful beautiful woman and she had a she had a crutch okay she\nhad the trouble uh walking on one deck i asked her what has happened\nand she said that five years ago she was in maui hawaii\nand she was eating a salad and some snail fell into the salad and apparently\nthere are neurotoxic snails over there and she got into coma for a year okay oh wow\nand apparently there is you know high chance of even just dying but she was in the coma at some point\nshe regained partially consciousness she was able to hear people in the room\npeople behave as she wouldn't be there you know at some point she started being\nable to speak but she was mumbling like a barely able to to express herself and\nat some point she got into wheelchair then at some point she actually noticed that she can move her uh\na toe and then she knew that she will be able to walk and then you know that's where she was\nfive years after and she said that since then she appreciates the fact that she can move her toe\nand i was thinking do i need to go through such experience to appreciate that i have i can move my\ntoe well that's really good story a really deep example yeah and in some sense it might be the case\nthat we don't see light if we haven't went through the darkness but i wouldn't say that we\nshould we shouldn't assume that that's the case which may we maybe will do engineer shortcuts\nyeah ilia had this you know belief that maybe one has to go for a week or six months\nto some challenging camp yeah to just experience you know a lot of\ndifficulties and then comes back and actually everything is bright everything is beautiful i'm with iliana it must be a\nrussian thing where are you from originally i'm i'm polish polish okay\ni'm tempted to say that explains a lot but uh yeah there's something about the russian the necessity of suffering i\nbelieve i believe suffering or rather struggle is necessary i believe that\nstruggle is necessary i mean in some sense you even look at the story of any superhero\nin that movie it's not that it was like everything like it goes easy easy i like how that's your ground truth\nit's the

{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Generating good ideas", "output": "of the greatest ideas in artificial intelligence what would you say is your process for developing good novel ideas\nyou have to be aware that clearly there are many other brilliant people around so\nyou have to ask yourself a question why the given idea\nlet's say wasn't uh tried by someone else and in some sense it has to\ndo with you know kind of simple it might sound simple but like i'm thinking outside of\nthe box and what do i mean here so for instance for a while people in academia they assumed\nthat you have a fixed data set and then you optimize the algorithms\nin order to get the best performance and that was so in great assumption\nthat no one thought about training models on anti-internet\nor like that that maybe some people thought about it but if it felt too too\nmany as unfair and in some sense that's almost like a it's not my idea or so but that's an\nexample of breaking a typical assumption so you want to be in the paradigm that\nyou are breaking a typical assumption in the context of the ai community\ngetting to pick your dataset as cheating correct and in some sense so that was a that was assumption that many people had\nout there and then if you free yourself from assumptions\nthen they are likely to achieve something that others cannot do and in some sense if you are\ntrying to do exactly the same things as others it's very likely that you're gonna have the same results yeah i\nbut there's also that kind of tension which is uh asking yourself the question why\nhaven't others done this because um\ni mean i get a lot of good ideas but i think probably most of them suck\nwhen they meet reality so so actually i think the other big piece\nis uh getting into habit of generating ideas training your brain toward generating ideas and not even\nsuspending judgment of the ideas so in some sense i noticed myself that\neven if i'm in the process of generating ideas if i tell myself oh that was a bad idea\nthen that actually interrupts the process and i cannot generate more ideas because i'm actually focused on the\nnegative part why it won't work yes but i created also environment in the way\nthat it's very easy for me to to store new ideas so for instance next to my bed\ni have a voice recorder and it happens to me often like i wake\nup in that during the night and i have some idea in the past i was writing them down on my phone but that\nmeans you know turning off this turning on the screen and that wakes me up or like pulling a paper which requires you\nknow turning on the light these days i just start recording it\nwhat do you think i don't know if you know who jim keller is i know team color he's a big proponent of thinking hard on\na problem right before sleep so that he can sleep through it and solve it in a sleep\nor like come up with radical stuff in his sleep he was trying to get me to do this so\nit happened from my experience perspective it happened to me many times during the high school\ndays when i was doing mathematics that i had the solution to my problem as\ni woke up at the moment regarding thinking hard\nabout the given problem is i'm trying to actually devote substantial amount of time to think\nabout important problems not just before the sleep like i'm organizing amount of the huge\nchunks of time such that i'm not constantly working on the urgent problems but i actually have time to\nthink about the important one so you do it naturally but his idea is that you kind of\nprime your brain to make sure that that's the focus you know oftentimes people have other worries in their life that's not\nfundamentally deep problems like i don't know uh just stupid drama in your life\nand even at work all that kind of stuff he wants to kind of pick the most important problem\nthat you're thinking about and go to bed on that i think that's why i mean the other thing that comes to my mind is\nalso i feel the most fresh in the morning so during the morning i try to work on\nthe most important things rather than i'm just being pulled by urgent things or checking email or so\nwhat do you do with the cause i've been doing the voice recorder thing too but i end up recording so many messages it's\nhard to organize i have the same problem now i have heard that google pixel is really good in\ntranscribing text and i might get a google pixel just for the sake of transcribing text yeah people listening\nto this if you have a good voice recorder suggestion that transcribed please let me know i it's some of it is uh this has to do\nwith uh uh open ai codex too like some of it is\nsimply like the friction i need uh apps that remove that friction between\nvoice and the organization of the resulting transcripts and all that kind of stuff\num but yes you're right absolutely like during uh for me it's walking sleep too\nbut walking and running especially running get a lot of thoughts during running and\nthere's there's no good mechanism for recording thoughts so one more thing that i do i have a\nseparate phone uh which i which has no apps and maybe it has like a\naudible or let's say kindle no one has this phone number this kind of my meditation phone yeah and\ni try to expand the amount of time that that's the phone that i'm having i it has also\ngoogle maps if i need to go somewhere and i also use this phone to write down ideas\nah that's really good idea that's a really good idea often actually what i end up doing is even sending a\nmessage from that phone to the other phone so that's actually my way of recording messages or i just put them\ninto notes i love it what advice would you give to a young person high school\n"}

life so try to live it optimally i can say that\nit's almost like i'm unbelievable to me\nwhere i am in my life i'm extremely grateful for actually people whom i met i would say i think that i'm\ndecently smart and so on uh but i think that\nactually to great extent where i am has to do with that people who i met\nwould you be okay if after this conversation you died so\nif i'm dead then it kind of i don't have a choice anymore so in some sense there's like plenty of\nthings that i would like to try out in my life [Music] i feel that you know i'm gradually going\none by one and i'm just doing them i think that the list will be always infinite yeah\nso might as well go today yeah i mean to be clear i'm not looking forward to die\ni would say if there is no choice i would accept it but like uh in some sense i'm\nif there would be a choice if there would be possibility to live i would fight for a living\ni find um it's more honest than real to think\nabout you know dying today at the end of the day that seems to me to at least to my brain\nmore honest slap in the face as opposed to i still have 10 years\nlike today then then i'm much more about appreciating the cup and the table and so on and less about like silly worldly\naccomplishments and all those kinds of things we we have in the company a person who\nsay at some point found out that they have cancer and that also gives you know huge perspective with respect to what\nmatters now yeah and you know often people in situations like that they conclude that actually what matters is\nhuman connection and love and uh that's people conclude also\nif you have kids because kids is family you uh i think tweeted\nwe don't assign the minus infinity reward to our death such a reward would prevent us from\ntaking any risk we wouldn't be able to cross the road in fear of being hit by a car so in the objective function you\nmentioned fear of death might be fundamental to the human condition so\nas i said let's assume that they're like a reward functions in our brain and\nand the interesting thing is even realization how different reward\nfunctions can play with your behavior as a matter of fact i wouldn't say that\nyou should assign infinite negative reward to anything because that messes up the math\nthe math doesn't work out it doesn't work out and as you said even you know uh government or some insurance\ncompanies you said they assign 99 million dollars to human life yeah and i'm just saying it with respect to\nthat might be a harsh statement to ourselves but in some sense that there is a finite value of our own life\ni'm trying to put it from perspective of being less of being more egoless\nand realizing fragility of my own life and in some sense\nthe fear of death might prevent you from acting\nbecause anything can cause death yeah and i'm sure actually if you were\nto put death in the objective function there's probably so many aspects to death and fear of death and\nrealization of death and mortality there's just whole components of\nfiniteness of not just your life but every experience and so on you're gonna have\nto formalize mathematically and also you know that might lead to\num you spending a lot of compute cycles on this like a\nand deliberating this terrible future instead of experiencing now\nand that in some sense is also kind of unpleasant simulation to run in your head yeah\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Meaning of life", "output": "do you think there's an objective function that describes the entirety of uh\nhuman life so you know usually the way you ask that is what is the meaning of life\nis there um a universal objective functions that captures the why of life so yeah i mean\ni suspected that they will ask this question but it's also a question that i asked myself many many times\nsee i can tell you a framework that i have these days to think about these questions so i think that fundamentally\nmeaning of life has to do with some of our reward functions that we have in brain and they might have to\ndo with let's say for instance curiosity or human connection which might mean\nunderstanding others it's also possible for a person to\nslightly modify their reward function usually they mostly stay fixed but it's possible to modify reward function and\nyou can pretty much choose so in some sense reward functions optimizing reward functions they will give you life\nsatisfaction is there some randomness in the function i think when you are born there is some\nrandomness like you can see that some people for instance they they care more about building stuff some\npeople care more about caring for others some people that there are all sorts of uh default\nreward functions and then in some sense you can ask yourself what's this like\nwhat is the satisfying way for you to go after this reward function and you just go after this reward function and you\nknow some people also ask are these reward functions real i almost think about it\nas let's say if you would have to discover mathematics\nin mathematics you are likely to run into various objects like a complex numbers\nor differentiation some other objects and these are very natural objects that arise and similarly the reward functions\nthat we are having in our brain they are somewhat very natural that you know there is a reward function for\nfor understanding like a comprehension yeah uh curiosity and so on so in some sense\nthey are in the same way natural as their natural objects in mathematics\ninteresting so you know there's the uh the old sort of debate is mathematics invented\nor discovered you're saying reward functions are discovered so nature so nature's provided some you can still\nlet's say expanded throughout the life some of the reward functions they might be futile like for instance there might\nbe a reward function maximize amount of wealth yeah and this is more like a a learning\nreward function and but we know also that some reward functions if you optimize them you won't\nbe quite satisfied well i don't know which part of your\nreward function resulted in you coming today but i am deeply appreciative that you did spend your valuable time with me\nwatching is really fun talking to you you're you're brilliant you're a good human being and it's an honor to meet\nyou and an honor to talk to you thanks for talking today brother thank you alex a lot i appreciated your\nquestions here i had a lot of time being here thanks for listening to this\nconversation with welch and ramba to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description\nand now let me leave you some words from arthur c clarke who is the author of\n2001 a space odyssey it may be that our role on this planet\nis not to worship god but to create him thank you for listening and hope to see\nyou next time\nyou\n"}
