{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Turing Test", "output": "am i an ai program you wrote to interview people until i get good enough to interview you\nwell i'll be impressed if if you were i'd be impressed by myself if you were i don't think we're quite up to that yet\nbut uh maybe you're from the future lex if you did would you tell me is that is that a good thing to tell a language\nmodel that's tasked with interviewing that it is in fact um ai maybe we're in\na kind of meta turing test uh probably probably it would be a good idea not to tell you so it doesn't change your\nbehavior right this is a kind of heisenberg uncertainty principle situation if i told you you behave differently yeah maybe that's what's\nhappening with us of course this is a benchmark from the future where they replay 2022 as a year before ais were\ngood enough yet and now we want to see is it going to pass exactly\nif i was such a program would you be able to tell do you think so to the touring test question\nyou've talked about the benchmark for solving intelligence\nwhat would be the impressive thing you've talked about winning a nobel prize in a system winning a nobel prize\nbut i still return to the touring test as a compelling test the spirit of the touring test is a compelling test\nyeah the turing test of course it's been unbelievably influential and turing's one of my all-time heroes but i think if\nyou look back at the 1950 papers original paper and read the original you'll see i don't think he meant it to\nbe a rigorous formal test i think it was more like a thought experiment almost a bit of philosophy he was writing if you\nlook at the style of the paper and you can see he didn't specify it very rigorously so for example he didn't\nspecify the knowledge that the expert or judge would have um not you know how\nmuch time would they have to investigate this so these important parameters if you were gonna make it uh a true sort of\nformal test um and you know some by some measures people claimed the turing test passed\nseveral you know a decade ago i remember someone claiming that with a with a kind of very bog standard normal uh\nlogic model um because they pretended it was a it was a kid so the the judges\nthought that the machine you know was was a was a child so um that would be\nvery different from an expert ai person uh interrogating a machine and knowing how it was built and so on so i think um\nyou know we should probably move away from that as a formal test and move more towards a general test where we test the\nai capabilities on a range of tasks and see if it reaches human level or above\nperformance on maybe thousands perhaps even millions of tasks eventually and cover the entire sort of cognitive space\nso i think for its time it was an amazing thought experiment and also 1950s obviously it\nwas barely the dawn of the computer age so of course he only thought about text and now um we have a lot more different\ninputs so yeah maybe the better thing to test is the generalizability so across\nmultiple tasks but i think it's also possible as as systems like god show\nthat eventually that might map right back to language so you might be able to demonstrate your ability to generalize\nacross tasks by then communicating your ability to generalize across tasks which is kind of\nwhat we do through conversation anyway when we jump around ultimately what's in there in that\nconversation is not just you moving around knowledge it's you moving around like these\nentirely different modalities of understanding that ultimately map to\nyour ability to to uh operate successfully in all these domains which you can think of as tasks\nyeah i think certainly we as humans use language as our main generalization communication tool so i think we end up\nthinking in language and expressing our solutions in language um so it's going to be very powerful\nuh uh mode in which to uh explain you know the system to explain what it's\ndoing um but i don't think it's the only uh uh modality that matters so i think\nthere's gonna be a lot of you know there's there's a lot of different ways to express uh capabilities uh other than\njust language yeah visual robotics body language\num yeah action is the interactive aspect of all that that's all part of it but what's interesting with gato is that\nit's a it's it's it's sort of pushing prediction to the maximum in terms of like you know mapping arbitrary\nsequences to other sequences and sort of just predicting what's going to happen next so prediction seems to be\nfundamental to intelligence and what you're predicting doesn't so much matter yeah it seems\nlike you can generalize that quite well so obviously language models predict the next word um gato predicts potentially\nany uh action or any token uh and it's just the beginning really it's our most general agent one could call it so far\nbut um you know that itself can be scaled up massively more than we've done so far obviously we're in the in the\nmiddle of doing that but the big part of solving agi is creating benchmarks that\nhelp us get closer and closer sort of creating benchmarks that test the journalizability and it's just still\ninteresting that this fella alan turing was one of the first and probably still\none of the only people that was trying maybe philosophically but was trying to formulate a benchmark that could be\nfollowed it is even though it's it's fuzzy it's still sufficiently rigorous to where you can\nrun that test and i still think something like the touring test will at the end of the day\nbe the thing that truly impresses other humans so that you can have a close friend\nwho's an ai system for that friend to be a good friend they're going to have to be able to\nuh play starcraft and they're going to have to do all of these tasks um get you a beer so the\nrobotics tasks uh play games with you use language\nhumor all those kinds of things but that ultimately can boil down to language it feels like not in terms of the ai\ncommunity but in terms of the actual impact of general intelligence on the world it feels like language will be the\nplace where it truly shines i think so because it's such an important kind of input output for us i think you're right\ni think the turing test that what the the kind of the the philosophy behind it which is the idea of can can a machine\nmimic the behaviors of a human and men and i would say wider than just language\nand text then you know in terms of actions and everything else creativity all these\nthings then um if it can sort of match or exceed human cognitive capabilities\nthen i think we have a you know true intelligence so i thought from that perspective you're right i think he did\nformulate the right uh kind of uh setup i just i think there'll be a kind of\nhumor in the ai systems of the future looking back to this conversation\nand thinking about the touring test and uh also thinking about\nby that time they would know which year they were finally able to sort of cross the threshold of human level\nintelligence and think how funny it is that we humans were still\nconfused about this whole problem that has been long ago been solved well hello to the ai agents of the\nfuture anyway so going back to your to your journey when did you fall in love with programming first\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Video games", "output": "well it's pretty uh pretty young age actually so um you know i started off uh actually games\nwas my first love so starting to play chess when i was around four years old and then um it was actually with\nwinnings from a chess competition that i managed to buy my first chess computer when i was about eight years old it was\na zx spectrum which was hugely popular in the uk at the time and uh it's amazing machine because i\nthink it trained a whole generation of programmers in the uk because it was so accessible you know you literally\nswitched it on and there was the basic prompt and you could just get going and um my parents didn't really know\nanything about computers so but because it was my money from a chess competition i could i could say i i wanted to buy it\nuh and then you know i just went to bookstores got books on programming and\num started typing in you know the programming code and and then of course um once you start doing that you start\nadjusting it and then making your own games and that's when i fell in love with computers and realized that they were a very magical device um in a way i\nkind of i would have been able to explain this at the time but i felt that they were sort of almost a magical extension of your mind i always had this\nfeeling and i've always loved this about computers that you can set them off doing something some task for you you\ncan go to sleep come back the next day and it's solved um you know that feels magical to me so\ni mean all machines do that to some extent they all enhance our natural capabilities obviously cars make us\nallow us to move faster than we can run but this was a machine to extend the mind\nand and then of course ai is the ultimate expression of what a machine may be able to do or learn so\nvery naturally for me that thought extended into into ai quite quickly remember the the programming language\nthat was first started special to the machine no it was just the base it was just i think it was just\nbasic uh on the zx spectrum i don't know what specific form it was and then later on i got a commodore amiga which uh\nwas a fantastic machine no you're just showing off so yeah well lots of my friends had atari st's and i i managed\nto get amigas it was a bit more powerful and uh and that was incredible and used to do um programming in assembler and\nand uh also amos basic this this specific form of basic it was incredible actually as well all my coding skills\nand when did you fall in love with ai so when did you first start to gain an understanding that you\ncan not just write programs that do some mathematical operations for you while you sleep but something that's\na keen to bringing an entity to life sort of\na thing that can figure out something more complicated than uh than a simple mathematical operation\nyeah so there was a few stages for me all while i was very young so first of all as i was trying to improve at\nplaying chess i was captaining various england junior chess teams and at the time when i was about you know maybe 10 11 years old i was gonna become a\nprofessional chess player that was my first thought um that dream was there sure she\ntried to get to the highest level yeah so i was um you know i got to when i was about 12 years old i got to master stand\nand i was second highest rated player in the world to judith polgar who obviously ended up being an amazing chess player\nand uh world women's champion and when i was trying to improve at chess where you\nknow what you do is you obviously first of all you're trying to improve your own thinking processes so that leads you to\nthinking about thinking how is your brain coming up with these ideas why is it making mistakes how can you how can\nyou improve that thought process but the second thing is that you it was just the beginning this was like in the in the\nearly 80s mid 80s of chess computers if you remember they were physical boards like the one we have in front of us and\nyou pressed down the you know the squares and i think kasparov had a branded version of it that i i i got and\num you were you know used to they're not as strong as they are today but they were they were pretty strong and you\nused to practice against them um to try and improve your openings and other things and so i remember i think i\nprobably got my first one i was around 11 or 12. and i remember thinking um this is amazing you know how how has\nsomeone programmed uh uh this this chess board to play chess uh and uh it was\nvery formative book i bought which was called the chess computer handbook by david levy which came out in 1984 or\nsomething so i must have got it when i was about 11 12 and it explained fully how these chess programs were made i\nremember my first ai program being uh programming my amiga it couldn't it\nwasn't powerful enough to play chess i couldn't write a whole chess program but i wrote a program for it to play othello\nreversey it's sometimes called i think in the u.s and so a slightly simpler game than chess but i used all of the\nprinciples that chess programs had alpha beta search all of that and that was my first ai program i remember that very\nwell was around 12 years old so that that that brought me into ai and then the second part was later on uh when i\nwas around 1617 and i was writing games professionally designing games uh writing a game called theme park which\num had ai as a core gameplay component as part of the simulation um and it sold\nyou know millions of copies around the world and people loved the way that the ai even though it was relatively simple\nby today's ai standards um was was reacting to the way you as the player played it so it was called a sandbox\ngame so it's one of the first types of games like that along with simcity and it meant that every game you played was\nunique is there something you could say just on a small tangent about\nreally impressive ai from a game design human enjoyment perspective\nreally impressive ai that you've seen in games and maybe what does it take to create ai system and how hard of a\nproblem is that so a million questions just as a brief tangent\nwell look i think um games uh games have been significant in my life for three reasons so first of\nall to to i was playing them and training myself on games when i was a kid then i went through a phase of\ndesigning games and writing ai4 games so all the games i i professionally wrote uh had ai as a core component and that\nwas mostly in the in the 90s and the reason i was doing that in games industry was at the time the games\nindustry i think was the cutting edge of technology so whether it was graphics with people like john carmack and quake\nand those kind of things or ai i think actually all the action was going on in\ngames and and we've seen we're still reaping the benefits of that even with things like gpus which you know i find\nironic was obviously invented for graphics computer graphics but then turns out to be amazingly useful for ai\nit just turns out everything's a matrix multiplication it appears you know in the whole world so um so i think games at the time had\nthe most cutting edge ai and a lot of the the games uh uh we you know i was involved in writing so there was a game\ncalled black and white which was one game i was involved with in the early stages of which i still think is the\nmost um impressive uh example of reinforcement learning in a computer game so in that\ngame you know you trained a little pet animal uh and yeah and it sort of learned from how you\nwere treating it so if you treated it badly then it became mean yeah and then it would be mean to to your villagers\nand your and your population the sort of uh the little tribe that you were running uh but if you were kind to it\nthen it would be kind and people were fascinated by how that was and so was i to be honest with the way it kind of\ndeveloped and um especially the mapping to good and evil yeah it made you made you realize made me realize that you can\nsort of in the way in the choices you make can define uh the\nwhere you end up and that means all of us are capable of the good\nuh evil it all matters in uh the different choices along the trajectory to those places that you make it's\nfascinating i mean games can do that philosophically to you and it's rare it seems rare yeah well games are i think a\nunique medium because um you as the player you're not just passively consuming the the entertainment right\nyou're actually actively involved as an as a as an agent so i think that's what makes it in some ways can be more\nvisceral than other other mediums like you know films and books so the second so that was you know designing ai and\ngames and then the third use uh uh i've we've used of ai is in deep mind from\nthe beginning which is using games as a testing ground for proving out ai\nalgorithms and developing ai algorithms and that was a that was a sort of um a core component of our vision at the\nstart of deepmind was that we would use games very heavily uh as our main testing ground certainly to begin with\num because it's super efficient to use games and also you know it's very easy to have metrics to see how well your\nsystems are improving and what direction your ideas are going in and whether you're making incremental improvements\nand because those games are often rooted in something that humans did for a long time beforehand\nthere's already a strong set of rules like it's already a damn good benchmark yes it's really good for\nso many reasons because you've got you've got you've got clear measures of how good humans can be at these things\nand in some cases like go we've been playing it for thousands of years um and and uh often they have scores or at\nleast win conditions so it's very easy for reward learning systems to get a reward it's very easy to specify what\nthat reward is um and uh also at the end it's easy to you know to test uh\nexternally you know how strong is your system by of course playing against you know the world's\nstrongest players at those games so it's it's so good for so many reasons and it's also very efficient to run\npotentially millions of simulations in parallel on the cloud so um i think\nthere's a huge reason why we were so successful back in you know starting out 2010 how come we were able to progress\nso quickly because we'd utilize games and um you know at the beginning of deep\nmind we also hired some amazing game engineers uh who i knew from my previous uh lives in the games industry and uh\nand that helped to bootstrap us very quickly and plus it's somehow super compelling almost at a philosophical\nlevel of man versus machine over over a chessboard or a go board\nand especially given that the entire history of ai is defined by people saying it's going to be impossible to\nmake a machine that beats a human being in chess and then once that happened\npeople were certain when i was coming up in ai that go is not a game that could be solved\nbecause of the combinatorial complexity it's just too it's it's it's you know\nno matter how much moore's law you have compute is just never going to be able to crack the game of go yeah and so that\nthen there's something compelling about facing sort of taking on the impossibility of that task from the\nai researcher perspective engineer perspective and then as a human being\njust observing this whole thing your beliefs about what you thought was\nimpossible being broken apart\nit's it's uh humbling to realize we're not as smart as we thought it's humbling to realize that the things\nwe think are impossible now perhaps will be done in the future there's something\nreally powerful about a game ai system being a human being in a game that\ndrives that message uh home for like millions billions of people especially in the case of go sure\nwell look i think it's a i mean it has been a fascinating journey and and especially as i i think about it from i\ncan understand it from both sides both as the ai you know creators of the ai um but also\nas a games player originally so you know it was a it was a really interesting it was i mean it was a fantastic um but\nalso somewhat bittersweet moment the alphago match for me um uh seeing that and and and being obviously heavily\nheavily involved in that um but you know as you say chess has been uh the i mean\nkasparov i think rightly called it the drosophila of of intelligence right so it's sort of i i love that phrase and\nand i think he's right because chess has been um hand in hand with ai from the\nbeginning of the the whole field right so i think every ai practitioner starting with turing and claude shannon\nand all those uh the sort of forefathers of of of of the field um tried their\nhand at writing a chess program uh i've got original audition of claude shannon's first chess program i think it\nwas 1949 uh the the original sort of uh paper and um they all did that and\nturing famously wrote a chess program that but all the computers around there were obviously too slow to run it so he\nhad to run he had to be the computer right so he literally i think spent two or three days running his own program by\nhand with pencil and paper and playing playing a friend of his uh with his chess program so\nof course deep blue was a huge moment uh beating off um but actually when that happened i\nremember that very very vividly of course because it was you know chess and computers and ai all the things i loved\nand i was at college at the time but i remember coming away from that being more impressed by kasparov's mind than i\nwas by deep blue because here was kasparov with his human mind not only could he play chess more or less to the\nsame level as this brute of a calculation machine um but of course kasparov can do everything else humans\ncan do ride a bike talk many languages do politics all the rest of the amazing things that kasparov does and so with\nthe same brain yeah and and yet deep blue uh brilliant as it was at chess it\nhad been hand coded for chess and um actually had distilled the knowledge of\nchess grand masters uh into into a cool program but it couldn't do anything else like it couldn't even play a strictly\nsimpler game like tic-tac-toe so um something to me was missing from um\nintelligence from that system that we would regard as intelligence and i think it was this idea of generality and and\nalso learning yeah um so and that's what we tried to do out with alphago yeah we\nalphago and alpha zero mu zero and then got on all the things that uh we'll get\ninto some parts of there's just a fascinating trajectory here but let's just stick on chess briefly uh on the\nhuman side of chess you've proposed that from a game design perspective the thing that makes chess\ncompelling as a game uh is that there's a creative tension between a bishop\nand the knight can you explain this first of all it's really interesting to think about what\nmakes the game compelling makes it stick across centuries\nyeah i was sort of thinking about this and actually a lot of even amazing chess players don't think about it necessarily from a games designer point of view so\nit's with my game design hat on that i was thinking about this why is chess so compelling and i think a critical uh reason is the\nthe dynamicness of of of the different kind of chess positions you can have whether they're closed or open and other\nthings comes from the bishop and the night so if you think about how different the the the capabilities of\nthe bishop and knight are in terms of the way they move and then somehow chess has evolved to balance those two\ncapabilities more or less equally so they're both roughly worth three points each so you think that dynamics was\nalways there and then the rest of the rules are kind of trying to stabilize the game well maybe i mean it's sort of\ni don't know his chicken and egg situation probably both came together but the fact that it's got to this beautiful equilibrium where you can have\nthe bishop and knight they're so different in power um but so equal in value across the set of the universe of\nall positions right somehow they've been balanced by humanity over hundreds of years um i think gives gives the game\nthe creative tension uh that you can swap the bishop and knights uh for a bishop for a knight and you you they're\nmore or less worth the same but now you aim for a different type of position if you have the knight you want a closed position if you have the bishop you want\nan open position so i think that creates a lot of the creative tension in chess so some kind of controlled creative\ntension from an ai perspective do you think ai systems convention\ndesign games that are optimally compelling to humans well that's an interesting question you\nknow sometimes i get asked about ai and creativity and and this and the way i answered that is relevant to that\nquestion which is that i think they're different levels of creativity one could say so i think um if we define\ncreativity as coming up with something original right that's that's useful for a purpose then you know i think the kind\nof lowest level of creativity is like an interpolation so an averaging of all the examples you see so maybe a very basic\nai system could say you could have that so you show it millions of pictures of cats and then you say give me an average\nlooking cat right generate me an average looking cat i would call that interpolation then there's extrapolation\nwhich something like alphago showed so alphago played you know millions of games of go against itself\nand then it came up with brilliant new ideas like move 37 in game two bringing a motif strategies and go that that no\nhumans had ever thought of even though we've played it for thousands of years and professionally for hundreds of years so that that i call that extrapolation\nbut then that's still there's still a level above that which is you know you could call out the box thinking or true\ninnovation which is could you invent go right could you invent chess and not just come up with a brilliant chess move\nor brilliant go move but can you can you actually invent chess or something as good as chess or go and i think one day\nuh ai could but what's missing is how would you even specify that task to a a\nprogram right now and the way i would do it if i was best telling a human to do it or a games designer a human games\ndesigner to do it is i would say something like go i would say um come up with a game that only takes five\nminutes to learn which go does because it's got simple rules but many lifetimes to master right or impossible to master\nin one lifetime because so deep and so complex um and then it's aesthetically beautiful uh and also uh it can be\ncompleted in three or four hours of gameplay time which is you know useful for our us you know in in a human day\nand so um you might specify these side of high level concepts like that and then you know with that and maybe a few\nother things uh one could imagine that go satisfies uh those those constraints\num but the problem is is that we we're not able to specify abstract notions\nlike that high-level abstract notions like that yet to our ai systems um and i think there's still something missing\nthere in terms of um high-level concepts or abstractions that they truly understand and that you know combinable\nand compositional um so for the moment i think ai is capable of doing\ninterpolation extrapolation but not true invention so coming up with rule sets\nuh and optimizing with complicated objectives around those rule sets we can't currently do\nbut you could take a specific rule set and then run a kind of self-play\nexperiment to see how long just observe how an ai system from scratch learns how long is that journey\nof learning and maybe if it satisfies some of those other things you mentioned in terms of quickness to learn and so on and you\ncould see a long journey to master for even an ai system then you could say that this is a promising game\num but it would be nice to do almost like alpha codes or programming rules so generating rules that kind of\nuh that automate even that part of the generation of rules so i have thought about systems actually um that i think\nwould be amazing in in for a games designer if you could have a system that um takes your game plays it tens of\nmillions of times maybe overnight and then self balances the rules better so it tweaks the the rules and the maybe\nthe equations and the and the and the parameters so that the game uh is more\nbalanced the units in the game or some of the rules could be tweaked so it's a bit of like a giving a base set\nand then allowing a monte carlo tree search or something like that to sort of explore it right and i think that would\nbe super super a powerful tool actually for for balancing auto balancing a game\nwhich usually takes thousands of hours from hundreds of games human games testers normally to to\nbalance some one you know game like starcraft which is you know blizzard are amazing at balancing their games but it\ntakes them years and years and years so one could imagine at some point when this uh this stuff becomes uh efficient\nenough to you know you might be able to do that like overnight do you think a game that is optimal\ndesigned by an ai system would look very much like uh planet\nearth maybe maybe it's only the sort of game i would love to make is is and i've tried\nyou know my in my game's career the games design career you know my first big game was designing a theme park an\namusement park then uh with games like republic i tried to you know have games where we designed whole cities and and\nallowed you to play in so and of course people like will wright have written games like sim earth uh trying to\nsimulate the whole of earth pretty tricky but um i see earth i haven't actually played that one so what is it\ndoes it incorporative evolution or yeah it has evolution and it's sort of um it tries to it sort of treats it as an\nentire biosphere but from quite a high level so nice to be able to sort of zoom in zoom\nout zoom in exactly so obviously he couldn't do that was in the night i think he wrote that in the 90s so it couldn't you know it wasn't

{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "AlphaFold", "output": "basic building blocks of biology that i think is another angle at which you can start\nto understand the human mind the human body which is quite fascinating which is from the basic building blocks start to\nsimulate start to model how from those building blocks you can construct bigger and bigger more complex\nsystems maybe one day the entirety of the human biology so here's another problem that thought to\nbe impossible to solve which is protein folding and alpha fold or\nspecific alpha fold 2 did just that it solved protein folding i think it's one of the biggest\nbreakthroughs uh certainly in the history of structural biology but uh in general in\nin science um maybe from a high level\nwhat is it and how does it work and then we can ask some fascinating sure questions after sure um so maybe\nlike to explain it uh to people not familiar with protein folding is you know i first of all explain proteins\nwhich is you know proteins are essential to all life every function in your body depends on proteins sometimes they're\ncalled the workhorses of biology and if you look into them and i've you know obviously as part of alpha fold i've been researching proteins and and\nstructural biology for the last few years you know they're amazing little bio nano machines proteins they're\nincredible if you actually watch little videos of how they work animations of how they work and um proteins are specified by their\ngenetic sequence called the amino acid sequence so you can think of those their genetic makeup and then in the body uh\nin in nature they when they when they fold up into a 3d structure so you can think of it as a string of beads and\nthen they fold up into a ball now the key thing is you want to know what that 3d structure is\nbecause the structure the 3d structure of a protein is what helps to determine what does it\ndo the function it does in your body and also if you're interested in drug drugs or disease you need to understand\nthat 3d structure because if you want to target something with a drug compound or about to block that something the\nprotein is doing uh you need to understand where it's going to bind on the surface of the protein so obviously\nin order to do that you need to understand the 3d structure so the structure is mapped to the function the structure is mapped to the function and\nthe structure is obviously somehow specified by the by the amino acid sequence and that's the in essence the\nprotein folding problem is can you just from the amino acid sequence the one-dimensional\nstring of letters can you immediately computationally predict the 3d structure right and this has been a\ngrand challenge in biology for over 50 years so i think it was first articulated by christian anfinsen a\nnobel prize winner in 1972 uh as part of his nobel prize winning lecture and he\njust speculated this should be possible to go from the amino acid sequence to the 3d structure we didn't say how so\ni you know it's been described to me as equivalent to fermat's last theorem but for biology right you should as somebody\nthat uh very well might win the nobel prize in the future but outside of that you should do more of that kind of thing\nin the margins just put random things that will take like 200 years to solve set people off for 200 years it should\nbe possible exactly and just don't give any interest exactly i think everyone's exactly should be i'll have to remember\nthat for future so yeah so he set off you know with this one throwaway remark just like fermat you know he he set off\nthis whole 50-year uh uh uh field really of computational\nbiology and and they had you know they got stuck they hadn't really got very far with doing this and and um until now\nuntil alpha fold came along this is done experimentally right very painstakingly so the rule of thumb is and you have to\nlike crystallize the protein which is really difficult some proteins can't be crystallized like membrane proteins and\nthen you have to use very expensive electron microscopes or x-ray crystallography machines really\npainstaking work to get the 3d structure and visualize the 3d structure so the rule of thumb in in experimental biology\nis that it takes one phd student their entire phd to do one protein uh and with\nalpha fold two we were able to predict the 3d structure in a matter of seconds\num and so we were you know over christmas we did the whole human proteome or every protein in the human\nbody all 20 000 proteins so the human proteins like the equivalent of the human genome but on protein space and uh\nand sort of revolutionize really what uh a structural biologist can do because\nnow um they don't have to worry about these painstaking experimentals you know should they put all of that effort in or\nnot they can almost just look up the structure of their proteins like a google search and so there's a data set on which it's\ntrained and how to map this amino acids because first of all it's incredible that a protein this little chemical\ncomputer is able to do that computation itself in some kind of distributed way and do it very quickly\nthat's a weird thing and they evolved that way because you know in the beginning i mean that's a great invention just the\nprotein itself yes i mean and then they there's i think probably a history of\nlike uh they evolved to have many of these proteins and those proteins figure out how to be computers\nthemselves in such a way that you can create structures that can interact in complexes with each other in order to\nform high level functions i mean it's a weird system that they figured it out well for sure i mean we you know maybe\nwe should talk about the origins of life too but proteins themselves i think are magical and incredible uh uh uh as i\nsaid little little bio-nano machines and um and and actually levantal who is another\nscientist uh uh a contemporary of anfinsen uh he he coined this eleventh\nhouse what became known as levantal's paradox which is exactly what you're saying he calculated roughly a protein\nan average protein which is maybe 2 000 amino acids bases long is um\nis is can fold in maybe 10 to the power 300 different conformations so there's\n10 to the power 300 different ways that protein could fold up and yet somehow in nature physics solves this solves this\nin a matter of milliseconds so proteins fold up in your body in you know sometimes in fractions of a second so\nphysics is somehow solving that search problem and just to be clear in many of these cases maybe you correct me if i'm\nwrong there's often a unique way for that sequence to form itself yes so\namong that huge number of possibilities yes it figures out a way how to stability\nuh in some cases there might be a misfunction so on which leads to a lot of the disorders and stuff like that but\nyes most of the time it's a unique mapping and that unique mapping is not obvious no exactly that's just what the\nproblem is exactly so there's a unique mapping usually in a healthy in if it's healthy and as you say in disease\nso for example alzheimer's one one one conjecture is that it's because of a misfolded protein a protein that folds\nin the wrong way amyloid beta protein so um and then because it falls in the wrong way it gets tangled up right in\nyour in your neurons so um it's super important to understand both healthy functioning and also\ndisease is to understand uh you know what what these things are doing and how they're structuring of course the next\nstep is sometimes proteins change shape when they interact with something so um they're not just static necessarily in\nin biology maybe you can give some interesting sort of beautiful things to you about these\nearly days of alpha fold of of solving this problem because unlike games this is\nreal physical systems that are less amenable to\nself-play type of mechanisms the the size of the data set is smaller that you might otherwise like so you\nhave to be very clever about certain things is there something you could speak to um what was very hard to solve and what are\nsome beautiful aspects about the the solution yeah i would say alpha fold is the most complex and also probably most\nmeaningful system we've built so far so it's been an amazing time actually in the last you know two three years to see\nthat come through because um as we talked about earlier you know games is what we started on uh building things\nlike alphago and alpha zero but really the ultimate goal was to um not just to crack games it was just to to to build\nuse them to bootstrap general learning systems we could then apply to real world challenges specifically my passion\nis scientific challenges like protein folding and then alpha fold of course is our first big proof point of that and so\num you know in terms of the data uh and the amount of innovations that had to go into it we you know it was like more\nthan 30 different component algorithms needed to be put together to crack the protein folding um i think some of the\nbig innovations were that um kind of building in some hard coded constraints around physics and\nevolutionary biology um to constrain sort of things like the bond angles uh\nuh in the in the in the protein and things like that um a lot but not to impact the learning\nsystem so still allowing uh the system to be able to learn the physics uh\nitself um from the examples that we had and the examples as you say there are only about 150 000 proteins even after\n40 years of experimental biology only around 150 000 proteins have been the structures have been found out about so\nthat was our training set which is um much less than normally we would like to use\nbut using various tricks things like self distillation so actually using alpha folds predictions um some of the\nbest predictions that it thought was highly confident in we put them back into the training set right to make the\ntraining set bigger that was critical to to alpha fold working so there was actually a huge\nnumber of different um uh innovations like that that were required to to ultimately crack the problem after fold\none what it produced was a distagram so a kind of a matrix of the pairwise distances\nbetween all of the molecules in the in the in the protein and then there had to be a separate optimization process to uh\ncreate the 3d structure and what we did for alpha volt2 is make it truly end to end so we went straight\nfrom the amino acid sequence of of of bases to the 3d structure directly without going\nthrough this intermediate step and in machine learning what we've always found is that the more end to end you can make\nit the better the system and it's probably because um we you know the in\nthe end the system is better at learning what the constraints are than than we are as the human designers of specifying\nit so anytime you can let it flow end to end and actually just generate what it is you're really looking for in this\ncase the 3d structure you're better off than having this intermediate step which you then have to hand craft the next\nstep for so so it's better to let the gradients and the learning flow all the way through the system um from the end point the end\noutput you want to the inputs so that's a good way to start a new problem handcraft a bunch of stuff add a bunch\nof manual constraints with a small intent learning piece or a small learning piece and grow that learning\npiece until it consumes the whole thing that's right and so you can also see you know this is a bit of a method we've\ndeveloped over doing many sort of successful outfits we call them alpha x projects right is and the easiest way to\nsee that is the evolution of alphago to alpha zero so alphago was um a learning\nsystem but it was specifically trained to only play go right so uh and what we wanted to do with first version of go is\njust get to world champion performance no matter how we did it right and then and then of course alphago zero we we we\nremoved the need to use human games as a starting point right so it could just play against itself from random starting\npoint from the beginning so that removed the the need for human knowledge uh about go and then finally alpha zero\nthen generalized it so that any things we had in there the system including things like symmetry of the go board uh\nwere removed so the alpha zero could play from scratch any two player game and then mu0 which is the final\nlatest version of that set of things was then extending it so that you didn't even have to give it the rules of the\ngame it would learn that for itself so it could also deal with computer games as well as board games so that line of\nalpha golf goes zero alpha zero mu zero that's the full trajectory of what you\ncan take from uh imitation learning to full self\nsupervised learning yeah exactly and learning learning uh the entire structure of the environment you put in\nfrom scratch right and and and and bootstrapping it uh through self-play uh yourself but the thing is it would have\nbeen impossible i think or very hard for us to build alpha zero or mu0 first out of the box\neven psychologically because you have to believe in yourself for a very long time you're constantly dealing with doubt\nbecause a lot of people say that it's impossible exactly so it was hard enough just to do go as you were saying everyone thought that was impossible or\nat least a decade away um from when we when we did it back in 2015 24 you know\n2016 and um and so yes it would have been psychologically probably very difficult\nas well as the fact that of course we learnt a lot by building alphago first right so it's i think this is why i call\nai in engineering science it's one of the most fascinating science disciplines but it's also an engineering science in\nthe sense that unlike natural sciences um the phenomenon you're studying it doesn't exist out in nature you have to\nbuild it first so you have to build the artifact first and then you can study how how and pull it apart and how it\nworks this is tough to uh ask you this question because you probably will say it's everything but\nlet's let's try let's try to think to this because you're in a very interesting position where deepmind is\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Solving intelligence", "output": "the place of some of the most uh brilliant ideas in the history of ai but it's also a place of brilliant\nengineering so how much of solving intelligence this big goal for deepmind how much of it is\nscience how much is engineering so how much is the algorithms how much is the data how much is the\nhardware compute infrastructure how much is it the software computer infrastructure yeah um what else is\nthere how much is the human infrastructure and like just the humans interact in certain kinds of ways in all the space\nof all those ideas how much does maybe like philosophy how much what's the key if um\nuh if if you were to sort of look back like if we go forward 200 years look back\nwhat was the key thing that solved intelligence is that ideas i think it's a combination first of all\nof course it's a combination of all those things but the the ratios of them changed over over time\nso yeah so um even in the last 12 years so we started deep mine in 2010 which is hard to imagine now because 2010 it's\nonly 12 short years ago but nobody was talking about ai uh you know if you remember back to your mit days you know\nno one was talking about it i did a postdoc at mit back around then and it was sort of thought of as a well look we\nknow ai doesn't work we tried this hard in the 90s at places like mit mostly losing using logic systems and\nold-fashioned sort of good old-fashioned ai we would call it now um people like minsky and and and patrick winston and\nyou know all these characters right and used to debate a few of them and they used to think i was mad thinking about that some new advance could be done with\nlearning systems and um i was actually pleased to hear that because at least you know you're on a unique track at\nthat point right even if every all of your you know professors are telling you you're mad that's true and of course in\nindustry uh you can we couldn't get you know as difficult to get two cents together uh and which is hard to imagine\nnow as well given it's the biggest sort of buzzword in in vcs and and fundraising's easy and all these kind of\nthings today so back in 2010 it was very difficult and what we the reason we started then and\nshane and i used to discuss um uh uh what were the sort of founding tenets of deep mind and it was very various things\none was um algorithmic advances so deep learning you know jeff hinton and cohen just had just sort of invented that in\nacademia but no one in industry knew about it uh we love reinforcement learning we thought that could be scaled\nup but also understanding about the human brain had advanced um quite a lot uh in the decade prior with fmri\nmachines and other things so we could get some good hints about architectures and algorithms and and sort of um\nrepresentations maybe that the brain uses so as at a systems level not at a implementation level um and then the\nother big things were compute and gpus right so we could see a compute was going to be really useful and it got to\na place where it became commoditized mostly through the games industry and and that could be taken advantage of and\nthen the final thing was also mathematical and theoretical definitions of intelligence so things like ai xi aix\nwhich uh shane worked on with his supervisor marcus hutter which is a sort of theoretical uh proof really of\nuniversal intelligence um which is actually a reinforcement learning system um in the limit i mean it assumes\ninfinite compute and infinite memory in the way you know like a turing machine proof but i was also waiting to see\nsomething like that too to you know like turing machines uh and and computation theory that people like turing and\nshannon came up with underpins modern computer science um uh you know i was waiting for a theory like that to sort\nof underpin agi research so when i you know met shane and saw he was working on something like that you know that to me\nwas a sort of final piece of the jigsaw so in the early days i would say that\nideas were the most important uh you know and for us it was deep reinforcement learning scaling up deep\nlearning um of course we've seen transformers so huge leaps i would say you know three or four from for if you\nthink from 2010 until now uh huge evolutions things like alphago um and um\nand and maybe there's a few more still needed but as we get closer to ai agi um\ni think engineering becomes more and more important and data because scale and of course the the recent you know\nresults of gpt3 and all the big language models and large models including our ones uh has shown that scale is a is and\nlarge models are clearly going to be unnecessary but perhaps not sufficient part of an agi solution and\nthroughout that like you said and i'd like to give you a big thank you you're one of the pioneers in this is\nsticking by ideas like reinforcement learning that this can actually work\ngiven actually limited success in the past and also\nwhich we still don't know but proudly having the best researchers in the world\nand talking about solving intelligence so talking about whatever you call it agi or something like this\nthat speaking of mit that's that's just something not you wouldn't bring up no uh not not maybe you did in uh like 40\n50 years ago but that was um ai was a place where you do tinkering\nvery small scale not very ambitious projects and maybe the biggest ambitious projects\nwere in the space of robotics and doing like the darpa challenge sure but the task of solving intelligence and\nbelieving you can that's really really powerful so in order for engineering to do its work\nto have great engineers build great systems you have to have that belief that threats throughout the whole thing\nthat you can actually solve some of these impossible challenges yeah that's right and and back in 2010 you know our\nmission statement um and still is today you know it was used to be uh solving step one solve intelligence step two use\nit to solve everything else yes so if you can imagine pitching that to a vc in 2010 you know the kind of looks we we\ngot we managed to you know find a few uh kooky people to back us but it was uh it was tricky and and i and i got to the\npoint where we we wouldn't mention it to any of our professors because they would just eye roll and think we you know\ncommitted career suicide and and uh and and you know so it was there's a lot of things that we had to do but we always\nbelieved it and one reason you know by the way one reason we i believe i've always believed in reinforcement learning is that\nthat if you look at neuroscience that is the way that the you know primate brain learns one of the main mechanisms is the\ndopamine system implement some form of td learning a very famous result in the late 90s uh where they saw this in\nmonkeys and uh and as a you know proper game prediction error so we you know again in the limit this is this is what\ni think you can use neuroscience for is is you know any at mathematics you when you're when you're doing something as\nambitious as trying to solve intelligence and you're you're you know it's blue sky research no one knows how to do it you you you need to use any\nevidence or any source of information you can to help guide you in the right direction or give you confidence you're\ngoing in the right direction so so that that was one reason we pushed so hard on that and that's and just going back to\nyour early question about organization the other big thing that i think we innovated with at deepmind to encourage\ninvention and and uh and innovation was the multi-disciplinary organization we\nbuilt and we still have today so deepmind originally was a confluence of the of the most cutting-edge knowledge\nin neuroscience with machine learning engineering and mathematics right and and gaming\nand then since then we built that out even further so we have philosophers here and and uh by you know ethicists\nbut also other types of scientists physicists and so on um and that's what brings together i tried to build a sort\nof um new type of bell labs but in this golden era right uh\nand and a new expression of that um to try and uh foster this incredible sort\nof innovation machine so talking about the humans in the machine the mind itself is a learning machine\nwith a lots of amazing human minds in it coming together to try and build these uh learning systems\nif we return to the big ambitious dream of alpha fold that may be the early steps on a very\nlong journey in um in biology\ndo you think the same kind of approach can use to predict the structure and function of more complex biological\nsystems so multi-protein interaction and then i mean you can go out from there just\nsimulating bigger and bigger systems that eventually simulate something like the human brain or the human body just\nthe big mush the mess of the beautiful resilient mesobiology do do you see that\nas a long-term vision i do and i think um you know if you think about what are the\nthings top things i wanted to apply ai ai2 once we had powerful enough systems biology and curing diseases and\nunderstanding biology uh was right up there you know top of my list that's one of the reasons i personally pushed that\nmyself and with alpha fold but i think alpha fold uh amazing as it is is just\nthe beginning um and and and i hope it's evidence of uh what could be done with\ncomputational methods so um you know alpha fold solve this this huge problem of the structure of proteins but biology\nis dynamic so really what i imagine from here we're working on all these things now is protein protein interaction uh\nprotein ligand binding so reacting with molecules um then you want to get build up to pathways and then eventually a\nvirtual cell that's my dream uh maybe in the next 10 years and i've been talking actually to a lot of biologists friends\nof mine paul nurse who runs the qrik institute amazing biologist nobel prize winning biologist we've been discussing\nfor 20 years now virtual cells could you build a virtual simulation of a cell and\nif you could that would be incredible for biology and disease discovery because you could do loads of experiments on the virtual cell and then\nonly at the last stage validate it in the wet lab so you could you know in terms of the search space of discovering\nnew drugs you know it takes 10 years roughly to go from uh uh to to go from uh you know identifying a target to uh\nhaving a drug candidate um maybe that could be shortened to you know by an order of magnitude with if you could do\nmost of that that that work in silico so in order to get to a virtual cell\nwe have to build up uh uh understanding of different parts of biology and the interactions and and um so you know\nevery every few years we talk about this with i talked about this with paul and then finally last year after alpha fault\ni said now is the time we can finally go for it and and alpha falls the first proof point that this might be possible\nuh and he's very excited when we have some collaborations with his with his lab they're just across the road actually from us as you know wonderful\nbeing here in king's cross with the quick institute across the road and um and i think the next steps you know i\nthink there's going to be some amazing advances in biology built on top of things like alpha fold uh we're already\nseeing that with the community doing that after we've open sourced it and released it um and uh you know i also i\noften say that i think uh if you think of mathematics is the perfect description language for physics\ni think ai might be end up being the perfect description language for biology because\nbiology is so messy it's so emergent so dynamic and complex um i think i find it\nvery hard to believe we'll ever get to something as elegant as newton's laws of motions to describe a cell right it's\njust too complicated um so i think ai is the right tool for this you have to uh\nyou have to start at the basic building blocks and use ai to run the simulation for all those building blocks so have a\nvery strong way to do prediction of what given these building blocks what kind of biology how the\nthe function and the evolution of that biological system it's almost like a cellular automata you\nhave to run you can't analyze it from a high level you have to take the basic ingredients figure out the rules yeah\nand let it run but in this case the rules are very difficult to figure out yes yes learn them that's exactly it so\nit's the biology is too complicated to figure out the rules it's it's it's too emergent too dynamic say compared to a\nphysics system like the motion of a planet yeah right and and so you have to learn the rules and that's exactly the\ntype of systems that we're building so you you mentioned you've open sourced alpha fold and even the data involved\n"}

that\nit's great to hear that you do and then the second thing was and mostly we did it because the person building it is uh\nuh would not it was not able to cope with supporting it anymore because it was it got too big for him his amazing\nprofessor uh who who built it in the first place so we helped him out with that and then with alpha folds even\nbigger i would say and i think in that case we decided that there were so many downstream applications of alpha fold um\nthat we couldn't possibly even imagine what they all were so the best way to accelerate uh drug discovery and also\nfundamental research would be to to um give all that data away and and and the\nand the and the system itself um you know it's been so gratifying to see what people have done that within just one\nyear which is a short amount of time in science and uh it's been used by over 500 000 researchers have used it we\nthink that's almost every biologist in the world i think there's roughly 500 000 biologists in the world professional biologists have used it to to look at\ntheir proteins of interest we've seen amazing fundamental research done so a couple of weeks ago front\ncover there was a whole special issue of science including the front cover which had the nuclear pore complex on it which\nis one of the biggest proteins in the body the nuclear poor complex is a protein that governs all the nutrients\ngoing in and out of your cell nucleus so they're like little hole gateways that open and close to let things go in and\nout of your cell nucleus so they're really important but they're huge because they're massive doughnut rings shaped things and they've been looking\nto try and figure out that structure for decades and they have lots of you know experimental data but it's too low\nresolution there's bits missing and they were able to like a giant lego jigsaw puzzle use alpha fold predictions plus\nexperimental data and combined those two independent sources of information uh actually four different groups around\nthe world were able to put it together the sec more or less simultaneously using alpha fault predictions so that's\nbeen amazing to see and pretty much every pharma company every drug company executive i've spoken to has said that\ntheir teams are using alpha fold to accelerate whatever drugs uh uh they're\ntrying to discover so i think the knock-on effect has been enormous in terms of uh the impact that uh\nalpha-fold has made and it's probably bringing in it's creating biologists it's bringing more people into the field\num both on the excitement and both on the technical skills involved and um\nit's almost like uh a gateway drug to biology yes it is you get more computational people involved too\nhopefully and and i think for us you know the next stage as i said you know in future we have to have other\nconsiderations too we're building on top of alpha fold and these other ideas i discussed with you about protein protein interactions and and genomics and other\nthings and not everything will be open source some of it will will do commercially because that will be the best way to actually get the most\nresources and impact behind it in other ways some other projects will do non-profit style um and also we have to\nconsider for future things as well safety and ethics as well like but you know synthetic biology there are you\nknow there is dual use and we have to think about that as well with alpha fold we you know we consulted with 30\ndifferent bioethicists and and other people expert in this field to make sure it was safe before um we released it so\nthere'll be other considerations in future but for right now you know i think alpha fold is a kind of a gift from us to to to the scientific\ncommunity so i'm pretty sure that something like alpha fold\nuh would be part of nobel prizes in the future but us humans of course are horrible\nwith credit assignment so we'll of course give it to the humans do you think there will be a day\nwhen ai system can't be denied that it earned that nobel prize do you\nthink we'll see that in 21st century it depends what type of ais we end up building right whether they're um\nyou know goal seeking agents who specifies the goals uh who comes up with the hypotheses\nwho you know who determines which problems to tackle right so i think it's about an announcement yeah so it's\nannouncing the results exactly as part of it um so i think right now of course it's it's it's it's amazing human\ningenuity that's behind these systems and then the system in my opinion is just a tool you know it'd be a bit like\nsaying with galileo and his telescope you know the ingenuity the the the credit should go to the telescope i mean\nit's clearly galileo building the tool which he then uses so i still see that in the same way\ntoday even though these tools learn for themselves um they're i think i think of things like alpha fold and that the\nthings we're building as the ultimate tools for science and for acquiring new knowledge to help us as scientists\nacquire new knowledge i think one day there will come a point where an ai system may solve or come up with\nsomething like general relativity of its own bat not just by averaging everything on the internet or\naveraging everything on pubmed although that would be interesting to see what that would come up with um so\nthat to me is a bit like our earlier debate about creativity you know inventing go rather than just coming up\nwith a good go move and um so i think uh solving i think to to you know if we\nwanted to give it the credit of like a nobel type of thing then it would need to invent go uh and sort of invent that\nnew conjecture out of the blue um rather than being specified by the the human\nscientists or the human creators so i think right now that's it's definitely just a tool although it is interesting\nhow far you get by averaging everything on the internet like you said because you know a lot of people do see science as you're\nalways standing on the shoulders of giants and the question is how much are you really\nreaching up above the shoulders of giants maybe it's just assimilating different kinds\nof results of the past with ultimately this new perspective that gives you this breakthrough idea\nbut that idea may not be novel in the way that we can't be already discovered on the internet maybe\nthe nobel prizes of the next 100 years are already all there on the internet to be discovered\nthey could be they could be i mean i think um this is one of the big mysteries i think\nis that uh uh i i first of all i believe a lot of the big new breakthroughs that are going\nto come in the next few decades and even in the last decade are going to come at the intersection between different subject areas where um there'll be some\nnew connection that's found between what seemingly with disparate areas and and one can even think of deep mind as i\nsaid earlier as a sort of interdisciplinary between neuroscience ideas and ai engineering ideas uh\noriginally and so um so i think there's that and then one of the things we can't\nimagine today is and one of the reasons i think people we were so surprised by how well large models worked is that\nactually it's very hard for our human minds our limited human minds to understand what it would be like to read the whole\ninternet right i think we can do a thought experiment and i used to do this of like well what if i read the whole of\nwikipedia what would i know and i think our minds can just about comprehend maybe what that would be like but the whole\ninternet is beyond comprehension so i think we just don't understand what it would be like to be able to hold all of\nthat in mind potentially right and then active at once and then maybe what are\nthe connections that are available there so i think no doubt there are huge things to be discovered just like that\nbut i do think there is this other type of creativity of true spark of new knowledge new idea never thought before\nabout can't be average from things that are known um that really of course everything come you know nobody creates\nin a vacuum so there must be clues somewhere but just a unique way of putting those things together i think\nsome of the greatest scientists in history have displayed that i would say although it's very hard to know going\nback to their time what was exactly known uh when they came up with those things although\nyou're making me really think because just the thought experiment of deeply knowing a hundred wikipedia pages\ni don't think i can um i've been really impressed by wikipedia for for technical topics yeah so if you\nknow a hundred pages or a thousand pages i don't think who can visually truly\ncomprehend what's what kind of intelligence that is that's a pretty powerful intelligence if you\nknow how to use that and integrate that information correctly yes i think you can go really far you can probably\nconstruct thought experiments based on that like simulate different ideas so if this\nis true let me run this thought experiment then maybe this is true it's not really invention it's like just\ntaking literally the knowledge and using it to construct a very basic simulation of the world i mean some argue it's\nromantic in part but einstein would do the same kind of things with a thought experiment yeah one could imagine doing\nthat systematically across millions of wikipedia pages plus pubmed all these things i think there are\nmany many things to be discovered like that they're hugely useful you know you could imagine and i want us to do some\nof those things in material science like room temperature superconductors or something on my list one day i'd like to\nlike you know have an ai system to help build better optimized batteries all of these sort of mechanical things mr i\nthink a systematic sort of search could be uh guided by a model could be um could be\nextremely powerful so speaking of which you have a paper on nuclear fusion\n"}

{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Origin of life", "output": "all yourself what do you think um how the heck did life originate on earth\nyeah well maybe we i'll come to that in a second but i think the ultimate use of ai is to\nkind of use it to accelerate science to the maximum so i um think of it a little bit like the\ntree of all knowledge if you imagine that's all the knowledge there is in the universe to attain and we sort of barely scratched the\nsurface of that so far in even though you know we've we've done pretty well since the enlightenment right as\nhumanity and i think ai will turbo charge all of that like we've seen with alpha fold and i want to explore as much\nof that tree of knowledge as it's possible to do and um and i think that involves ai helping us with with with\nunderstanding or finding patterns um but also potentially designing and building new tools experimental tools so i think\nthat's all uh and also running simulations and learning simulations all of that we're\nalready we're sort of doing it at a at a at a you know baby steps level here but\ni can imagine that in in in the decades to come as uh you know what's the full\nflourishing of of that line of thinking it's going to be truly incredible i would say if i visualize this tree of\nknowledge something tells me that that knowledge for tree of knowledge for humans is much smaller\nin the set of all possible trees of knowledge is actually quite small giving our cognitive\nlimitations limited cognitive capabilities that even\nwith with the tools we build we still won't be able to understand a lot of things and that's perhaps what non-human\nsystems might be able to reach farther not just as tools but in themselves understanding\nsomething that they can bring back yeah it could well be so i mean there's so many things that that are sort of\nencapsulated in what you just said there i think first of all um there's there's two different things there's like what do we understand today\nyeah what could the human mind understand and what is the totality of what is there to be understood yeah\nright and so there's three consensus you know you can think of them as three larger and larger trees or exploring\nmore branches of that tree and i i think with ai we're going to explore that whole lot now the question is is uh you\nknow if you think about what is the totality of what could be understood um there may be some fundamental physics\nreasons why certain things can't be understood like what's outside the simulation or outside the universe maybe\nit's not understandable from within the universe so that's there may be some hard constraints like that you know it could\nbe smaller constraints like um we think of space time as fundamental\nus our human brains are really used to this idea of a three-dimensional world with time right\nmaybe but our tools could go beyond that they wouldn't have that limitation necessary they could think in 11\ndimensions 12 dimensions whatever is needed but um we could still maybe understand that in several different\nways the example i always give is um when i you know play gary kasparov at speed chess or we've talked about chess\nand these kind of things um you know he if you if you if you're reasonably good at chess you can um you can't come up\nwith the move gary comes up with in his move but he can explain it to you and you can understand and you can understand post hoc the reasoning yeah\nso so i think there's a there's an even further level of like well maybe you couldn't have invented that thing but\nbut using like going back to using language again perhaps you can understand and appreciate that same way\nlike you can appreciate you know vivaldi or mozart or something without you can appreciate the beauty of that without um\nbeing able to to construct it yourself right invent the music yourself so i think we see this in all forms of life\nso it'll be that times you know a million but it would you can imagine also one sign of intelligence is the\nability to explain things clearly and simply right you know people like richard feynman another one of my all-time heroes used to say that right\nif you can't you know if you can explain it something simply then you that's a that's the best sign a complex topic\nsimply then that's one of the best signs of you understanding it yeah so i can see myself talking trash in the ai\nsystem in that way yes uh it gets frustrated how dumb i am and trying to explain something to me i was\nlike well that means you're not intelligent because if you were intelligent you'd be able to explain it simply yeah of course you know there's\nalso the other option of course we could enhance ourselves and and without devices we we are already sort of\nsymbiotic with our compute devices right with our phones and other things and you know this stuff like neural link and etc\nthat could be could could advance that further um so i think there's lots of lots of really amazing possibilities uh\nthat i could foresee from here well let me ask you some wild questions so out there looking for friends\n"}
{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Aliens", "output": "do you think there's a lot of alien civilizations out there so i guess this also goes back to your\norigin of life question too because i think that that's key um my personal opinion looking at all this\nand and you know it's one of my hobbies physics i guess so so i i you know it's something i think about a lot and talk\nto a lot of experts on and and and read a lot of books on and i think my feeling currently is that that we are\nalone i think that's the most likely scenario given what what evidence we have so um and the reasoning is i think\nthat you know we've tried since uh things like seti program and i guess since the\ndawning of the the space age uh we've you know had telescopes open radio telescopes and other things and if you\nthink about um and try to detect signals now if you think about the evolution of humans on earth we could have easily\nbeen um a million years ahead of our time now or million years behind quite\neasily with just some slightly different quirk thing happening hundreds of thousands years ago uh you know things\ncould have been slightly different if the bto had hit the dinosaurs a million years earlier maybe things would have evolved uh we'd be a million years\nahead of where we are now so what that means is if you imagine where humanity will be in a few hundred years let alone\na million years especially if we hopefully um you know solve things like climate change and other things and we continue\nto flourish and we build things like ai and we do space traveling and all of the stuff\nthat that humans have dreamed of for forever right and sci-fi has talked about forever um\nwe will be spreading across the stars right and void neumann famously calculated you know it would only take\nabout a million years if you send out von neumann probes to the nearest you know the nearest uh uh other solar\nsystems and and then they built all they did was build two more versions of themselves and set those two out to the\nnext nearest systems uh you you know within a million years i think you would have one of these probes in every system\nin the galaxy so it's not actually in cosmo cosmological time that's actually a very short amount of time\nso and and you know we've people like dyson have thought about constructing dyson spheres around stars to collect\nall the energy coming out of the star you know that there would be constructions like that would be visible across base um probably even across a\ngalaxy so and then you know if you think about all of our radio television uh\nemissions that have gone out since since the you know 30s and 40s um imagine a\nmillion years of that and now hundreds of civilizations doing that when we opened our ears at the point we got\ntechnologically sophisticated enough in the space age we should have heard a cacophony of voices we should\nhave joined that cacophony of voices and what we did we opened our ears and we heard nothing\nand many people who argue that there are aliens would say well we haven't really done exhaustive search yet and maybe\nwe're looking in the wrong bands and and we've got the wrong devices and we wouldn't notice what an alien form was\nlike to be so different to what we're used to but you know i'm not i don't really buy that that it shouldn't be as\ndifficult as that like we i think we've searched enough there should be if it were everywhere if it was it should be everywhere we should see dyson's fears\nbeing put up sun's blinking in and out you know there should be a lot of evidence for those things and then there are other people argue well the sort of\nsafari view of like well we're a primitive species still because we're not space faring yet and and and we're\nyou know there's some kind of globe like universal rule not to interfere star trek rule but like look look we can't\neven coordinate humans to deal with climate change and we're one species what is the chance that of all of these\ndifferent human civilization you know alien civilizations they would have the same priorities and and and and agree\nacross you know these kind of matters and even if that was true and we were in some sort of safari for our own good to\nme that's not much different from the simulation hypothesis because what does it mean the simulation hypothesis i think in its most fundamental level it\nmeans what we're seeing is not quite reality right it's something there's something more deeper underlying it\nmaybe computational now if we were in a if we were in a sort of safari park and\neverything we were seeing was a hologram and it was projected by the aliens or whatever that to me is not much different than thinking we're inside of\nanother universe because we still can't see true reality right i mean there's there's other explanations it could be\nthat the way they're communicating is just fundamentally different that we're too dumb to understand the much better\nmethods of communication they have it could be i mean i mean it's silly to say but\nour own thoughts could be the methods by which they're communicating like the place from which our ideas writers talk\nabout this like the muse yeah it sounds like very kind of uh\nwild but it could be thoughts it could be some interactions with our mind that we\nthink are originating from us is actually something that uh\nis coming from other life forms elsewhere consciousness itself might be that it could be but i don't see any\nsensible argument to the why why would all of the alien species be using this way yes some of them will be more\nprimitive they would be close to our level you know there would there should be a whole sort of normal distribution\nof these things right some would be aggressive some would be you know curious others would be very stoical and\nphilosophical because you know maybe they're a million years older than us but it's not it shouldn't be like what i\nmean one one alien civilization might be like that communicating thoughts and others but i don't see why you know\npotentially the hundreds there should be would be uniform in this way right it could be a violent dictatorship that the\nthe people the alien civilizations that uh become successful\nbecome um [Music] gain the ability to be destructive an\norder of magnitude more destructive but of course the the sad thought\nwell either humans are very special we took a lot of leaps that arrived at what it\nmeans to be human yeah um there's a question there which was the hardest which was the most special but\nalso if others have reached this level and maybe many others have reached this level the great filter\nthat prevented them from going farther to becoming a multi-planetary species or reaching out into the stars\nand those are really important questions for us whether um whether there's other alien\ncivilizations out there or not this is very useful for us to think about if we destroy ourselves\nhow will we do it and how easy is it to do yeah well you know these are big questions and i've thought about these a\nlot but the the the interesting thing is that if we're if we're alone that's somewhat comforting from the\ngreat filter perspective because it probably means the great filters were are past us and i'm pretty sure they are\nso that by in going back to your origin of life question there are some incredible things that no one knows how\nhappened like obviously the first life form from chemical soup that seems pretty hard but i would guess the\nmulticellular i wouldn't be that surprised if we saw single single cell sort of life forms elsewhere\nuh bacteria type things but multicellular life seems incredibly hard that step of you know capturing\nmitochondria and then sort of using that as part of yourself you know when you've just eaten it would you say that's the\nbiggest the most uh like if if you had to choose one sort of uh\nhitchhiker's got this galaxy one sentence summary of like oh those clever creatures did this that would be the\nmultilist i think that was probably the one that that's the biggest i mean there's a great book called the 10 grand great inventions of evolution by nick\nlane and he speculates on 10 10 of these you know what could be great filters um\ni think that's one i think the the advent of of intelligence and and conscious intelligence and in order you\nknow to us to be able to do science and things like that is huge as well i mean it's only evolved once as far as you\nknow uh in in earth history so that would be a later candidate but there's\ncertainly for the early candidates i think multicellular life forms is huge by the way what it's interesting to ask\nyou if you can hypothesize about what is the origin of intelligence is it\n"}

{"pod": "Lex Fridman Podcast", "input": "Conscious AI", "output": "quirks of the human mind of this evolved system is that it appears to be\nconscious this thing that we don't quite understand but it seems very\nvery special its ability to have a subjective experience that it feels like something\nto eat a cookie the deliciousness of it or see a color and that kind of stuff do you think in order to solve intelligence\nwe also need to solve consciousness along the way do you think agi systems need to have consciousness in order to\nbe truly intelligent yeah we thought about this a lot actually and um i think that\nmy guess is that consciousness and intelligence are double dissociable so you can have one without the other both\nways and i think you can see that with consciousness in that i think some animals and pets if you have a pet dog\nor something like that you can see some of the higher animals and dolphins things like that are uh have\nself-awareness and uh very sociable um seem to dream um you know those kinds of\na lot of the traits one would regard as being kind of conscious and self-aware um and but yet they're not that smart\nright uh so they're not that intelligent by by say iq standards or something like that yeah it's also possible that our\nunderstanding of intelligence is flawed like putting an iq to it sure maybe the thing that a dog can do\nis actually gone very far along the path of intelligence and we humans are just able to\nplay chess and maybe write poems right but if we go back to the idea of agi and general intelligence you know dogs are\nvery specialized right most animals are pretty specialized they can be amazing at what they do but they're like kind of elite sports sports people or something\nright so they do one thing extremely well because their entire brain is is optimized they have somehow convinced\nthe entirety of the human population to feed them and service them so in some way they're controlling yes exactly well\nwe co-evolved to some crazy degree right uh including the the way the dogs you know even even wag their tails and\ntwitch their noses right we find we're finding inexorably cute yeah um but i think um you can also see intelligence\non the other side so systems like artificial systems that are amazingly smart at certain things like maybe\nplaying go and chess and other things but they don't feel at all in any shape or form conscious in the way that you\nknow you do to me or i do to you and um and i think actually\nbuilding ai is uh these intelligent constructs uh is one of the best ways to explore the\nmystery of consciousness to break it down because um we're going to have devices that are\npretty smart at certain things or capable of certain things but potentially won't have any semblance of\nself-awareness or other things and in fact i would advocate if there's a choice building systems in\nthe first place ai systems that are not conscious to begin with uh are just tools um until we understand them better\nand the capabilities better so on that topic just not as the ceo of deep mind\njust as a human being let me ask you about this one particular anecdotal evidence of the google engineer\nwho made a comment or believed that there's some aspect of a language model\nthe lambda language model that exhibited sentience so you said you believe there might be a\nresponsibility to build systems that are not essential and this experience of a particular engineer i think i'd love to\nget your general opinion on this kind of thing but i think it will happen more and more and more which uh not when engineers but when\npeople out there that don't have an engineering background start interacting with increasingly intelligent systems\nwe anthropomorphize them they they start to have deep impactful\num interactions with us in a way that we miss them yeah when they're gone and\nwe sure feel like they're living entities self-aware entities and maybe even we project sentience onto\nthem so what what's your thought about this particular uh system was is uh\nhave you ever met a language model that's sentient no i no no what do you make of the case\nof when you kind of feel that there's some elements of sentience to this system yeah so this is you know\nan interesting question and uh uh obviously a very fundamental one so first thing to say is i think that\nnone of the systems we have today i i would say even have one iota of uh semblance of consciousness or sentience\nthat's my personal feeling interacting with them every day so i think that's way premature to be discussing what that\nengineer talked about i appreciate i think at the moment it's more of a projection of the way our own minds work\nwhich is to see uh uh uh sort of purpose and direction\nin almost anything that we you know our brains are trained to interpret uh agency basically in things uh even the\nan inanimate thing sometimes and of course with a a language system because language is so fundamental to\nintelligence that's going to be easy for us to anthropomorphize that i mean back in the day even the first uh\nyou know the dumbest sort of template chatbots ever eliza and and and and the ilk of the original chatbots back in the\n60s fooled some people under certain circumstances right they pretended to be a psychologist so just basically rabbit\nback to you the same question you asked it back to you um and uh some people believe that so i\ndon't think we can this is why i think the turing test is a little bit flawed as a formal test because it depends on the sophistication of the of the judge\num whether or not they are qualified to make that distinction so\ni think we should uh talk to you know the the top philosophers about this people like daniel dennett and uh david\nchalmers and others who've obviously thought deeply about consciousness of course consciousness itself hasn't been\nwell there's no agreed definition if i was to you know uh speculate about that\nuh you know i kind of the definite the working definition i like is it's the way information feels when you know it\ngets processed i think maybe max tegmark came up with that i like that idea i don't know if it helps us get towards any more operational thing but but it's\nit's it's i think it's a nice way of viewing it um i think we can obviously see from neuroscience certain\nprerequisites that are required like self-awareness i think is necessary but not sufficient component this idea of a\nself and other and set of coherent preferences that are coherent over time\nyou know these things are maybe memory um these things are probably needed for a sentient or conscious being um but but\nthe reason that the difficult thing i think for us when we get and i think this is a really interesting philosophical debate is when we get\ncloser to agi and and and you know and and much more powerful systems than we have today\num how are we going to make this judgment and one way which is the turing test is sort of a behavioral judgment is\nis the system exhibiting all the behaviors um that a human sentient uh or\na sentient being would would would exhibit um is it answering the right questions is it saying the right things is it indistinguishable from a human um\nand so on but i think there's a second thing that makes us as humans regard each other as\nsentient right why do we why do we think this and i debated this with daniel dennett and i think there's a second reason that's often overlooked which is\nthat we're running on the same substrate right so if we're exhibiting the same behavior uh more or less as humans and\nwe're running on the same you know carbon-based biological substrate the squishy you know few pounds of of flesh\nin our skulls then the most parsimonious i think explanation is that you're\nfeeling the same thing as i'm feeling right but we will never have that second part the substrate equivalence with a\nmachine right so we will have to only judge based on the behavior and i think the substrate equivalence is a critical part\nof why we make assumptions that we're conscious and in fact even with with animals high-level animals why we think\nthey might be because they're exhibiting some of the behaviors we would expect from a sentient animal and we know they're made of the same things\nbiological neurons so we're gonna have to come up with explanations uh or models of the gap\nbetween substrate differences between machines and humans did to get anywhere\nbeyond the behavioral but to me sort of the practical question is very interesting and very important when\nyou have millions perhaps billions of people believing that you have ascension ai believing what that google engineer\nbelieved which i just see is an obvious very near-term future thing certainly on\nthe path to agi how does that change the world what's the responsibility of the ai\nsystem to help those millions of people and also what's the ethical thing because\nyou can you can make a lot of people happy by creating a meaningful deep experience\nwith a system that's faking it before it makes it yeah and i i don't\nis a are we the right or who is to say what's the right thing to do should ai\nalways be tools like why why why are we constraining ais to always be tools as\nopposed to friends yeah i think well i mean these are you know you know fantastic\nquestions and and also critical ones and we've been thinking about this uh since\nthe start of d minor before that because we planned for success and you know how how you know you know however remote\nthat looked like back in 2010 and we've always had sort of these ethical considerations as fundamental at\ndeepmind um and my current thinking on the language models is and and large models is they're not ready we don't\nunderstand them well enough yet um and you know in terms of analysis tools and and guard rails what they can and can't\ndo and so on to deploy them at scale because i think you know there are big still ethical questions like should an\nai system always announce that it is an ai system to begin with probably yes um\nit what what do you do about answering those philosophical questions about the feelings uh people may have about ai\nsystems perhaps incorrectly attributed so i think there's a whole bunch of research that needs to be done first um\nto responsibly before you know you can responsibly deploy these systems at scale that would be at least be my\ncurrent position over time i'm very confident we'll have those tools like interpretability\nquestions um and uh analysis questions uh and then\nwith the ethical quandary you know i think there it's important to\nuh look beyond just science that's why i think philosophy social sciences even\ntheology other things like that come into it where um what you know arts and humanities what what does it mean to be\nhuman and the spirit of being human and and to enhance that and and the human condition right and allow us to\nexperience things we could never experience before and improve the the overall human condition and humanity\noverall you know get radical abundance solve many scientific problems solve disease so this is the era i think this\nis the amazing era i think we're heading into if we do it right um but we've got to be careful we've already seen with\nthings like social media how dual use technologies can be misused by firstly\nby by by bad you know p bad actors or naive actors or crazy actors right so\nthere's that set of just the common or garden misuse of existing dual use technology and then of course there's an\nadditional uh uh thing that has to be overcome with ai that eventually it may have its own agency so it could be uh uh\nuh good or bad in in in of itself so i think these questions have to be approached very carefully um using the\nscientific method i would say in terms of hypothesis generation careful control testing not live a b testing out in the\nworld because with powerful dual technologies like ai if something goes wrong it may cause you\nknow a lot of harm before you can fix it um it's not like a you know an imaging app or game app where you know that if\nif something goes wrong it's relatively easy to fix and and the harm's relatively small so i think\nit comes with you know the the the usual uh cliche of like with a lot of power\ncomes a lot of responsibility and i think that's the case here with things like ai given the the enormous\nopportunity in front of us and i think we need a lot of voices uh and as many\ninputs into things like the design of the systems and the values they should have and what goals should\nthey be put to um i think as wide a group of voices as possible beyond just the technologies is needed uh to input\ninto that and to have a say in that especially when it comes to deployment of these systems which is when the\nrubber really hits the road it really affects the general person in the street rather than fundamental research and\nthat's why i say i think as a first step it would be better if we have the choice to build\nthese systems as tools to give and i'm not saying that it should never they should never go beyond tools because of\ncourse the potential is there um for it to go way beyond just tools uh but um i\nthink that would be a good first step in order for us to you know allow us to carefully experiment understand what\nthese things can do so the leap between tool to sentient entity being is one\nshould take very careful yes let me ask a dark personal question so you're one of the most brilliant\n"}

on the world what they should\ndo to have a career they can be proud of her to have a life they can be proud of i love giving talks to the next\ngeneration what i say to them is actually two things i i think the most important things to learn about and to\nfind out about when you're when you're young is what are your true passions is first of all there's two things one is\nfind your true passions and i think you can do that by the way to do that is to explore as many things as possible when\nyou're young and you you have the time and you and you can take those risks um i would also encourage people to look at\nthe finding the connections between things in a unique way i think that's a really great way to find a passion second thing\ni would say advise is know yourself so spend a lot of time\nunderstanding how you work best like what are the optimal times to work what are the optimal ways that you study um\nwhat are your how do you deal with pressure sort of test yourself in various scenarios and try and improve your\nweaknesses but also find out what your unique skills and strengths are and then\nhone those so then that's what will be your super value in the world later on and if you can then combine those two\nthings and find passions that you're genuinely excited about that intersect with what your unique strong skills are\nthen you're you know you're on to something incredible and and you know i think you can make a huge difference in the world so let me ask about know\nyourself this is fun this is fun quick questions about day in the life the\nperfect day the perfect productive day in the life of demise's house yeah maybe uh maybe these days you're um\nthere's a lot involved yeah it may be a slightly younger you could focus on a demonstration\nproject maybe um how early do you wake up are you night owl do you wake up early in the morning\nwhat are some interesting habits uh how many dozens of cups of coffees do you drink a day what's the computer um\nthat you use uh what's the setup how many screens what kind of keyboard are we talking uh\nemacs vim are we talking something more modern so it's a bunch of those questions so maybe uh day in the life\nwhat what's the perfect day involved well these days it's quite different from say 10 20 years ago back 10 20\nyears ago it would have been you know a whole day of research individual research or\nprogramming doing some experiment neuroscience computer science experiment reading lots of research papers uh and\nthen perhaps at night time you know um reading science fiction books or or uh\nplaying uh some games but lots of focus so like deep focused work on whether\nit's uh programming or reading research paper yes yes so that would be a lot of debrief you know uh focused work these\ndays for the last sort of i guess you know five to ten years i've actually got quite a structure that works very well\nfor me now which is that um i'm a night complete night out always have been so i optimized for that so you know i get you\nknow i basically do a normal day's work get into work about 11 o'clock and sort of do work to about seven uh in the\noffice uh and i will arrange back-to-back meetings for the entire time of that and with as many me as many\npeople as possible so that's my collaboration management part of the day then i go home uh spend time with the\nfamily and friends uh have dinner uh uh relax a little bit and then i start a\nsecond day of work i call it my second day work around 10 pm 11 p.m and that's the time till about the small hours of\nthe morning four five in the morning where i will do my thinking and reading\na research writing research papers um sadly don't have time to code anymore\nbut it's it's not efficient to to do that uh these days uh given the amount of time i have um but that's when i do\nyou know maybe do the long kind of stretches of of thinking and planning and then probably you know using using\nemail or other things i would set i would fire off a lot of things to my team to deal with the next morning for\nactually thinking about this overnight we should go for this project or arrange this meeting the next day when you're\nthinking through a problem are you talking about a sheet of paper or the patent pen is there some independent structure yeah i like processes i still\nlike pencil and paper best for working out things but um these days it's just so efficient to read research papers\njust on the screen i still often print them out actually i still prefer to mark out things and i find it goes into\nthe brain quick better and sticks in the brain better when you're you're still using physical pen and pencil and paper\nso you take notes with the i have lots of nodes electronic ones and also um whole stacks of notebooks that\num that i use at home yeah on some of these most challenging next steps for example stuff\nnone of us know about that you're working on you're thinking there's some deep thinking required\nthere right like what what is the right problem what is the right approach because you're gonna have to invest a\nhuge amount of time for the whole team they're going to have to pursue this thing what's the right way to do it is\nis rl going to work here or not yes um what's the right thing to try what's the right benchmark to use yeah we need to\nconstruct a benchmark from scratch all those kinds of things yes so i think all those kind of things in the night time\nphase but also much more um i find i've always found the quiet hours of the\nmorning um when everyone's asleep it's super quiet outside um i love that time\nit's the golden hours like between like one and three in the morning um put some music on some inspiring music on and\nthen um think these deep thoughts so that's when i would read you know my philosophy books and uh spinoza's my you\nknow recent favorite can all these things i i i you know read about a great uh uh\na scientist of history how they did things how they thought things so that's when you do all your create that's when\ni do all my creative thinking and it's good i think i think people recommend you know you do your your your sort of\ncreative thinking in one block and the way i organize the day that way i don't get interrupted because obviously no one\nelse is up uh at those times so i can i can go uh you know as i can sort of get\nsuper deep and super into flow the other nice thing about doing it night time wise is if i'm really uh onto something\nor i've i've got really deep into something i can choose to extend it and i'll go into six in the morning whatever\nand then i'll just pay for it the next day yeah cause i'll be a bit tired and i won't be my best but that's fine i can\ndecide looking at my schedule the next day that and given where i'm at with this particular thought or creative idea\nthat i'm going to pay that cost the next day so so i think that's that's more flexible than morning people who do that\nyou know they get up at four in the morning they can also do those golden hours then but then their start of their schedule day starts at breakfast you\nknow 8 a.m whatever they have their first meeting and then it's hard you have to reschedule a day if you're in flow yeah that's going to be i don't\nhave to see that special threat of thoughts that the you're too passionate about you that\nthis is where some of the greatest ideas could potentially come is when you just lose yourself late into yeah\nand for the meetings i mean you're loading in really hard problems in a very short amount of time so you have to\ndo some kind of first principles thinking here it's like what's the problem what's the state of things what's the right next step yes you have\nto get really good at context switching which is one of the hardest things because especially as we do so many\nthings if you include all the scientific things we do scientific fields we're working in these are entire you know\ncomplex fields in themselves and you you have to sort of keep up to abreast of that but i enjoy it i've always been uh\na sort of generalist in a way and that's actually what happened with my games career after chess i i i one of the\nreasons i stopped playing chess was that i got into computers but also i started realizing there were many other great games out there to play too so\ni've always been that way inclined multidisciplinary and there's too many interesting things in in the world to spend all your time just on one thing\nso you mentioned spinoza gotta ask the big ridiculously big question about life\n"}
