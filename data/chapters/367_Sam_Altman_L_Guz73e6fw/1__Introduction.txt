We have been a misunderstood and badly mocked org for a long time like when we started
And we like announced the org at the end of 2015
And said we're going to work on agi like people thought we were batshit insane. Yeah, you know, like I
I remember at the time a eminent ai scientist at a
Large industrial ai lab
Was like dming individual reporters being like, you know, these people aren't very good and it's ridiculous to talk about agi
I can't believe you're giving them time of day and it's like that was the level of like
pettiness and rancor in the field at a new group of people saying we're going to try to build agi
So open ai and deep mind was a small collection of folks who are brave enough to talk
about agi
um
in the face of mockery
We don't get mocked as much now
Don't get mocked as much now
The following is a conversation with sam altman ceo of open ai
the company behind gpt4 jet gpt dolly codex and many other ai technologies
Which both individually and together constitute some of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of artificial intelligence
computing and humanity in general
Please allow me to say a few words about the possibilities and the dangers of ai
In this current moment in the history of human civilization
I believe it is a critical moment. We stand on the precipice of fundamental societal transformation where soon
Nobody knows when but many including me believe it's within our lifetime
the collective intelligence of the human species
Begins to pale in comparison by many orders of magnitude to the general super intelligence
in the ai systems we build and deploy
at scale
This is both exciting and terrifying
It is exciting because of the innumerable applications
We know
And don't yet know that will empower humans to create to flourish
to escape the widespread poverty and suffering that exists in the world today and
to succeed in that old all-too-human pursuit of happiness
It is terrifying because of the power that super intelligent agi wields to destroy human civilization
intentionally or unintentionally
the power to suffocate the human spirit in the
totalitarian way of george orwell's 1984
or the pleasure-fueled mass hysteria
of brave new world
Where as huxley saw it people come to love their oppression
To adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think
That is why these conversations with the leaders engineers and philosophers both optimists and cynics
is important now
These are not merely technical conversations about ai
These are conversations about power about companies institutions and political systems that deploy check and balance this power
about distributed economic systems that
incentivize the safety and human alignment of this power
about the psychology of the engineers and leaders that deploy agi and about the history of human nature
our capacity for good
and evil at scale
I'm deeply honored to have gotten to know and to have spoken with on and off the mic with many folks who
Now work at open ai including sam altman greg brockman ilius de scaver
Wojciech, zaremba andre karpathy
jacob, uh pachalki and many others
It means the world that sam has been totally open with me willing to have multiple conversations
including challenging ones on and off the mic
I will continue to have these conversations to both celebrate the incredible accomplishments of the ai community
And to steel man the critical perspective on major decisions various companies and leaders make
Always with the goal of trying to help in my small way
If I fail I will work hard to improve
I love you all
