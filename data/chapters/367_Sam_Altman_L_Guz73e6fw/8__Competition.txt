Open source there's going to be a lot of large language models
under this pressure
How do you continue prioritizing safety versus um, I mean there's several pressures
So one of them is a market driven pressure from
other companies, uh
Google apple meta and smaller companies. How do you resist the pressure from that?
Or how do you navigate that pressure you stick with what you believe in you stick to your mission?
You know, i'm sure people will get ahead of us in all sorts of ways and take shortcuts. We're not going to take
Um, and we just aren't going to do that. How do you out compete them?
I think there's going to be many agis in the world so we don't have to like out compete everyone
We're going to contribute one
Other people are going to contribute some
I think up I think multiple agis in the world with some differences in how they're built and what they do and what they're focused on
I think that's good
um, we have a very unusual structure, so
We don't have this incentive to capture unlimited value. I worry about the people who do but you know, hopefully it's all going to work out
but
We're a weird org and we're good at
Resisting product like we have been a misunderstood and badly mocked org for a long time like when we started
And we like announced the org at the end of 2015
And said we're going to work on agi like people thought we were batshit insane. Yeah, you know, like I
I remember at the time a uh, eminent ai scientist at a
Large industrial ai lab
Was like dming individual reporters being like, you know, these people aren't very good and it's ridiculous to talk about agi
and I can't believe you're giving them time of day and it's like that was the level of like
Pettiness and rancor in the field at a new group of people saying we're going to try to build agi
So open ai and deep mind was a small collection of folks who are brave enough to talk
about agi
um
in the face of mockery
We don't get mocked as much now
Don't get mocked as much now
uh, so speaking about the structure of the uh of the
of the org
